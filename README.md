## Omnifia Open-Domain Question-Answering Software
This software aims to answer users question like a chatbot based on their own data collected by Omnifia platform. Many services such as Gmail and slack are connected to the platform by which the software gets access to the data. 
The algorithm consists of three cosequtive parts:


1.   Refining data to label them in clusters
2.   Finding the most related context to the question
3.   Answering question based on the found context

**Note:** The "text_data" folder is the sample dataset taken from Kaggle[link text](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/questionanswer-dataset) dataset. We need this beside our project, but the Squad dataset will be downloaded inside project and is added to this repo for convenience.

More details are included in the ipynb file.
