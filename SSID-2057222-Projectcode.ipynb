              "{'context': 'Ghana\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Republic of Ghana is a country in West Africa. It borders Côte d\\'Ivoire (also known as Ivory Coast) to the west, Burkina Faso to the north, Togo to the east, and the Gulf of Guinea to the south. The word \"Ghana\" means \"Warrior King\", Jackson, John G. Introduction to African Civilizations, 2001. Page 201.  and was the source of the name \"Guinea\" (via French Guinoye) used to refer to the West African coast (as in Gulf of Guinea).\\n\\nGhana was inhabited in pre-colonial times by a number of ancient kingdoms, including the Ga Adangbes on the eastern coast, inland Empire of Ashanti and various Fante states along the coast and inland. Trade with European states flourished after contact with the Portuguese in the 15th century, and the British established a crown colony, Gold Coast, in 1874. MacLean, Iain. Rational Choice and British Politics: An Analysis of Rhetoric and Manipulation from Peel to Blair, 2001. Page 76.\\n\\nUpon achieving independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, Peter N. Stearns and William Leonard Langer. The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged, 2001. Page 1050.  the name Ghana was chosen for the new nation to reflect the ancient Empire of Ghana that once extended throughout much of western Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedieval Ghana (4th - 13th Century):The Republic of Ghana is named after the medieval Ghana Empire of West Africa. The actual name of the Empire was Wagadugu. Ghana was the title of the kings who ruled the kingdom. It was controlled by Sundiata in 1240 AD, and absorbed into the larger Mali Empire. (Mali Empire reached its peak of success under Mansa Musa around 1307.)\\n\\nGeographically, the old Ghana is 500 miles north of the present Ghana, and occupied the area between Rivers Senegal and Niger.\\n\\nSome inhabitants of present Ghana had ancestors linked with the medieval Ghana. This can be traced down to the Mande and Voltaic people of Northern Ghana--Mamprussi, Dagomba and the Gonja.\\n\\nAnecdotal evidence connected the Akans to this Empire. The evidence lies in names like Danso shared by the Akans of present Ghana and Mandikas of Senegal/Gambia who have strong links with the Empire.\\n\\nGhana was also the site of the Empire of Ashanti which was the most advanced black state in sub-Sahara Africa. It is said that at its peak, the King of Ashanti could field 500,000 troops.\\n\\nGold Coast & European Exploration: Before March 1957 Ghana was called the Gold Coast. The Portuguese who came to Ghana in the 15th Century found so much gold between the rivers Ankobra and the Volta that they named the place Mina - meaning Mine. The Gold Coast was later adopted to by the English colonisers. Similarly, the French, equally impressed by the trinkets worn by the coastal people, named The Ivory Coast, Cote d\\'Ivoire.\\n\\nIn 1482, the Portuguese built the Elmina Castle. Their aim was to trade in gold, ivory and slaves. In 1481 King John II of Portugal sent Diogo d\\'Azambuja to build this castle.\\n\\nIn 1598 the Dutch joined them, and built forts at Komenda and Kormantsi. In 1637 they captured the castle from the Portuguese and that of Axim in 1642 (Fort St Anthony). Other European traders joined in by the mid 17th century. These were the English, Danes and Swedes. The coastline was dotted by more than 30 forts and castles built by the Dutch, British and the Danish merchants, the highest concentration of European military architecture outside of Europe. By the latter part of 19th century the Dutch and the British were the only traders left and when the Dutch withdrew in 1874, Britain made the Gold Coast a crown colony.\\n\\nFor most of central sub-Saharan Africa, agricultural expansion marked the period before 500. Farming began earliest on the southern tips of the Sahara, eventually giving rise to village settlements. Toward the end of the classical era, larger regional kingdoms were formed in West Africa, one of which was the Kingdom of Ghana, north of what is today the nation of Ghana. After its fall at the beginning of the 13th century, Akan migrants moved southward then founded several nation-states including the first great Akan empire of the Bono which is now known as the ibalBrong Ahafo region in Ghana. Later Akan groups such as the Ashanti federation and Fante states are thought to possibly have roots in the original Bono settlement at Bono manso. Much of the area was united under the Empire of Ashanti by the 16th century. The Ashanti government operated first as a loose network and eventually as a centralized kingdom with an advanced, highly-specialized bureaucracy centered in Kumasi.\\n\\nThe first contact between the Ghanaian peoples, the Fantes on the coastal area and Europeans occurred in 1482. The Portuguese  first landed at Elmina, a coastal city inhabited by the Fanti nation-state in 1482. During the next few centuries parts of the area were controlled by British, Portuguese, and Scandinavian powers, with the British ultimately prevailing. These nation-states maintained varying alliances with the colonial powers and each other, which resulted in the 1806 Ashanti-Fante War, as well as an ongoing struggle by the Empire of Ashanti against the British. Moves toward regional de-colonization began in 1946, and the area\\'s first constitution was promulgated in 1951.\\n\\nFormed from the merger of the British colony Gold Coast, The Empire of Ashanti and the British Togoland trust territory by a UN sponsored plebiscite, Ghana became the first democratic sub-Sahara country in colonial Africa to gain its independence in 1957. Kwame Nkrumah, founder and first president of the modern Ghanaian state, was not only an African anti-colonial leader but also one with a dream of a united Africa which would not drift into neo-colonialism. He was the first African head of state to espouse Pan-Africanism, an idea he came into contact with during his studies at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania (United States), at the time when Marcus Garvey was becoming famous for his \"Back to Africa Movement.\" He merged the dreams of both Marcus Garvey and the celebrated African-American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois into the formation of the modern day Ghana. Ghana\\'s principles of freedom and justice, equity and free education for all, irrespective of ethnic background, religion or creed borrow from Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah\\'s implementation of Pan-Africanism.\\n\\nNkrumah was overthrown by a supported CIA-backed coup Interview with John Stockwell in Pandora\\'s Box: Black Power (Adam Curtis, BBC Two, 22 June 1992)        On Nkrumah assassination by CIA: Gaines, Kevin (2006) American Africans in Ghana, Black expatriates and the Civil Rights Era, The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill. . A series of subsequent coups ended with the ascension to power of Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings in 1981. These changes resulted in the suspension of the constitution in 1981 and the banning of political parties. A new constitution, restoring multi-party politics, was promulgated in 1992, and Rawlings was elected as president in the free and fair elections of that year and again won the elections 1996 to serve his second term. The constitution prohibited him from running for a third term. John Kufuor, the current president, is now serving his second term, which ends in 2008 where another election will be held to elect a new president. The year 2007 marks Ghana\\'s Golden Jubilee celebration of its 50-year anniversary, which was on March 6th, 1957.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGhana is a republic and member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Its head of state is President John Agyekum Kufuor, the ninth leader of the country since independence. The government sits at Osu Castle. The Parliament of Ghana is unicameral and dominated by two main parties, the New Patriotic Party and National Democratic Congress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell endowed with natural resources, Ghana has twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa. Even so, Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and technical assistance. Gold, timber, cocoa, diamond, bauxite, and manganese exports are major sources of foreign exchange.  The World Factbook   An oilfield which is reported to contain up to 3 billion barrels of light oil was discovered in 2007.\\n\\nThe domestic economy continues to revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 50% of GDP and employs 85% of the work force,  The World Factbook  mainly small landholders. Ghana made progress under a three-year structural adjustment programme in cooperation with the IMF.  On the negative side, public sector wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments have led to continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the Cedi, and rising public discontent with Ghana\\'s austerity measures. Even so, Ghana remains one of the more economically sound countries in all of Africa.\\n\\nThe country has since July, 2007, embarked on a currency re-denomination exercise, from Cedi (¢) to the new currency, the Ghana Cedi (GH¢). The transfer rate is 1 Ghana Cedi for every 10,000 Cedis. The Bank of Ghana has embarked upon an aggressive media campaign to educate the public about what re-denomination entails. The new Ghana Cedi is now exchanging at a rate of $1 USD =Gh¢ 0.93\\n\\nValue Added Tax is a consumption tax administered in Ghana. The tax regime which started in 1998 had a single rate but since September 2007 entered into a multiple rate regime.\\nIn 1998, the rate of tax was 10% and amended in 2000 to 21.5%. However with the passage of Act 734 of 2007, a 3% VAT Flat Rate Scheme (VFRS) begun to operate for the retail distribution sector. This allows retailers of taxable goods under Act 546 to charge a marginal 3% on their sales and account on same to the VAT Service. It is aimed at simplifying the tax system and increasing compliance.

The regions are:\\n\\n\\n\\nMap of Ghana\\n\\nGhana is a country located on the Gulf of Guinea, only a few degrees north of the Equator, therefore giving it a warm climate. The Greenwich Meridian also passes through Ghana, specifically through the industrial city of Ghana-Tema; so it is said that Ghana is geographically closer to the \"center\" of the world than any other country. La Cote d\\'Ivoire is located to the west of Ghana while Burkina Faso and Togo are located to its north and east respectively. The coastline is mostly a low, sandy shore backed by plains and scrub and intersected by several rivers and streams. A tropical rain forest belt, broken by heavily forested hills and many streams and rivers, extends northward from the shore. North of this belt, the land is covered by low bush, park-like savannah, and grassy plains.\\n\\nThe climate is tropical. The eastern coastal belt is warm and comparatively dry (see Dahomey Gap); the southwest corner, hot and humid; and the north, hot and dry. Lake Volta, the world\\'s largest artificial lake, extends through large portions of eastern Ghana.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor Ethnic groups: Akan 49%, Moshi-Dagomba 16%, Ewe 13%, Ga 8%.

English is the country\\'s official language and predominates government and business affairs. It is also the standard language used for educational instruction. Native Ghanaian languages are divided into two linguistic subfamilies of the Niger-Congo language family. Languages belonging to the Kwa subfamily are found predominantly to the south of the Volta River, while those belonging to the Gur subfamily are found predominantly to the north. The Kwa group, which is spoken by about 75% of the country\\'s population, includes the Akan, Ga-Dangme, and Ewe languages. The Gur group includes the Gurma, Grusi, and Dagbani languages.\\n\\nNine languages have the status of government-sponsored languages: Akan, Dagaare/Wale, Dagbani, Dangme, Ewe, Ga, Gonja, Kasem, and Nzema. Though not an official language, Hausa is the lingua-franca spoken among Ghana\\'s Muslims, who comprise about 14% of the population.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently, Ghana has 18,530 primary schools, 8,850 junior secondary schools, 900 senior secondary schools, 28 training colleges, 20 technical institutions, 4 diploma-awarding institutions, 6 public universities and over 10 private universities. That means that most Ghanaians have relatively easy access to primary and secondary education. These numbers can be contrasted with the single university and handful of secondary and primary schools that existed at the time of independence in 1957. Ghana\\'s spending on education has varied between 28 and 40 percent of its annual budget in the past decade. All teaching is done in English, Ghana\\'s official language.\\n\\nGhana has a 6-year primary education system beginning at the age of six and, under the educational reforms implemented in 1987, they pass on to a 3-year junior secondary school (JSS) program. At the end of the 3rd year of JSS, there is a Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE). Those continuing must complete the 3-year senior secondary school (SSS) program and take an admission exam to enter university. School enrollment totals over 2 million: 1.3 million primary; 550,000 middle; 300,000 secondary; 84,280 technical; 18,000 teacher training, and 89,000 in university.\\n\\nThe shortage of places in post-secondary education is acute; only one out of nine senior secondary graduates finds a place in a technical, teacher-training, or four-year university program.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n; Ghana News\\n\\n; Government\\n\\n; Healthcare\\n*  Unite For Sight at Buduburam Refugee Camp, Ghana A Unite For Sight video documentary with interviews of residents at Buduburam Refugee Camp, Ghana.

Populations also extend for considerable distances inland in regions with enough moisture to support suitable woodlands. The koalas of South Australia were largely exterminated during the early part of the 20th century, but the state has since been repopulated with Victorian stock. The koala is not found in Tasmania or Western Australia.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe word koala comes from the Dharuk gula. Although the vowel   was originally written in the Latin alphabet as \"oo\" (in spellings such as coola or koolah), it was changed to \"oa\" possibly due to an error.    The word is erroneously said to mean \"doesn\\'t drink\".\\n\\nThe scientific name of the koala\\'s genus, Phascolarctos, is derived from Greek phaskolos \"pouch\" and arktos \"bear\". Its species name, cinereus, is Latin and means \"ash-coloured\".\\n\\nAlthough the koala is not a bear, English-speaking settlers from the late 18th century first called it koala bear due to its similarity in appearance to bears. Although taxonomically incorrect, the name koala bear is still in use today outside Australia    — its use is discouraged because of the inaccuracy in the name.                Other descriptive English names based on \"bear\" have included monkey bear, native bear, and tree-bear.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Southern koala on Kangaroo Island, not native to the island\\nAlthough three subspecies have been described, these are arbitrary selections from a cline and are not generally accepted as valid. Following Bergmann\\'s Rule, southern individuals from the cooler climates are larger. A typical Victorian koala (formerly P. cinereus victor) has longer, thicker fur, is a darker, softer grey, often with chocolate-brown highlights on the back and forearms, and has a more prominently light-coloured ventral side and fluffy white ear tufts. Typical and New South Wales koala weights are   for males and   for females. In tropical and sub-tropical Queensland, however, the koala is smaller (at around   for an average male and just over   for an average female), a lighter often rather scruffy grey in colour, and has shorter, thinner fur. In Queensland, the koala was previously classified as the subspecies P. cinereus adustus, and the intermediate forms in New South Wales as P. cinereus cinereus. A fourth variation, though not technically a subspecies, is Phascolarctos cinereus aurum, or in English \"golden koala,\" which has a slight golden tinge to the fur as a result of an absence of the melanin pigment that produces albinism in most other mammalian species.  The variation from one form to another is continuous and there are substantial differences between individual koalas in any given region such as hair colour.\\nThe origins of the koala are unclear, although almost certainly they descended from terrestrial wombat-like animals. Koala fossils are quite rare, but some have been found in northern Australia dating to 20 million years ago. During this time, the northern half of Australia was rainforest. The koala did not specialise in a diet of eucalyptus until the climate cooled and eucalypt forests grew in the place of rainforests. The fossil record indicates that before 50,000 years ago, giant koalas inhabited the southern regions of Australia. The koala fills the same ecological role as the sloth of South America.\\n\\n\\n\\nFemale\\nKoalas have a slow metabolism and sleep for most of the day\\nThe koala is broadly similar in appearance to the wombat (its closest living relative),  but has a thicker coat, much larger ears, and longer limbs. The koala has large, sharp claws to assist with climbing tree trunks. Weight varies from about   for a large southern male, to about   for a small northern female. The koala\\'s five fingers are arranged with opposable thumbs, providing better gripping ability. The first two fingers are positioned in apposition on the front paws, and the first three fingers for the hind paws.    The koala is one of the few mammals (other than primates) that has fingerprints. Koala fingerprints are similar to human fingerprints; even with an electron microscope, it can be quite difficult to distinguish between the two.\\n\\nThe teeth of the koala are adapted to their herbivorous diet, and are similar to those of other diprotodont marsupials, such as kangaroos and wombats. They have sharp incisors to clip leaves at the front of the mouth, separated from the grinding cheek teeth by a wide diastema. The dental formula for koalas is:\\n\\nThe male koala, like many marsupials, has a bifurcated penis. The female has two lateral vaginas and two separate uteri, which is common to all marsupials.\\n\\nKoala walking along a branch. Koalas also walk on all four legs when walking on the ground\\nThe brain in the ancestors of the modern koala once filled the whole cranial cavity, but has become drastically reduced in the present species, a degeneration scientists suspect is an adaptation to a diet low in energy.    One of the smallest in marsupials with no more than 0.2% of its body weight,    about 40% of the cranial cavity is filled with cerebrospinal fluid, while the brain\\'s two cerebral hemispheres are like \"a pair of shrivelled walnut halves on top of the brain stem, in contact neither with each other nor the bones of the skull. It is the only animal on Earth with such a strangely reduced brain.\"\\n\\nIt is generally a silent animal, but males have a very loud advertising call that can be heard from almost a kilometre away during the breeding season. When under stress, koalas may issue a loud cry, which has been reported as similar to that of a human baby.    There is little reliable information about the lifespan of the koala, but in captivity they have been observed to reach the age of 18 years.\\n\\n\\n\\nA young joey, preserved at Port Macquarie Koala Hospital\\nBaby koala on a mothers back\\nFemales reach maturity at 2 to 3 years of age, males at 3 to 4 years. A healthy female koala can produce one young each year for about 12 years. Gestation is 35 days. Twins are very rare; the world\\'s first confirmed identical twin koalas, named \"Euca\" and \"Lyptus\", were born at the University of Queensland in April, 1999.  /ref>    Mating normally occurs between December and March, the Southern Hemisphere\\'s summer.\\n\\nA baby koala is referred to as a joey and is hairless, blind, and earless. At birth the joey, only a quarter of an inch long, crawls into the downward-facing pouch on the mother\\'s belly (which is closed by a drawstring-like muscle that the mother can tighten at will) and attaches itself to one of the two teats.\\n\\nYoung remain hidden in the pouch for about six months, only feeding on milk. During this time they grow ears, eyes, and fur. The joey then begins to explore outside of the pouch. At about this stage it begins to consume small quantities of the mother’s \"pap\" (formerly thought to be excrement, but now thought to come from the mother\\'s cecum) in order to inoculate its gut with the microbes necessary to digest eucalypt leaves.    The joey will remain with its mother for another six months or so, riding on her back, and feeding on both milk and eucalypt leaves until weaning is complete at about 12 months of age. Young females disperse to nearby areas at that time; young males often stay in the mother\\'s home range until they are two or three years old.\\n\\n\\n\\nKoala with young\\nKoala dozing during the day\\nThe koala lives almost entirely on eucalypt  leaves. This is likely to be an evolutionary adaptation that takes advantage of an otherwise unfilled ecological niche, since eucalypt leaves are low in protein, high in indigestible substances, and contain phenolic and terpene compounds that are toxic to most species. Like wombats and sloths, the koala has a very low metabolic rate for a mammal and rests motionless for about 16 to 18 hours a day, sleeping most of that time. Koalas can be aggressive towards each other, throwing a foreleg around their opponent and biting, though most aggressive behavior is brief squabbles.    Handling koalas may cause them stress,    and the issue of aggression and stress from handling is a political issue in Australia.\\n\\nKoalas spend about three of their five active hours eating. Feeding occurs at any time of day, but usually at night. Koalas eat an average of   of eucalypt leaves each day, chewing them with powerful jaws to a very fine paste before swallowing. The liver deactivates the toxic components ready for excretion, and the hind gut (especially the caecum) is greatly enlarged to extract the maximum amount of nutrient from the poor quality diet. Much of this is done through bacterial fermentation: while young are being weaned, the mother passes these essential digestive aids on to her offspring.  \\t \\nA koala eating eucalyptus\\nKoala in tree, scratching   grooming\\nThe koala will eat the leaves of a wide range of eucalypts, and occasionally even some non-eucalypt species such as Acacia, Leptospermum, and Melaleuca. It has firm preferences for particular varieties of eucalypt and these preferences vary from one region to another: in the south Manna Gum, Blue Gum, and Swamp Gum are favoured; Grey Gum and Tallowwood are important in the north, and the ubiquitous River Red Gum of the isolated seasonal swamps and watercourses that meander across the dry inland plains allows the koala to live in surprisingly arid areas. Many factors determine which of the 680 species of eucalypt trees the koala eats. Among trees of their favourite species, however, the major factor that determines which individual trees the koala chooses is the concentration of a group of phenolic toxins called formylated phloroglucinol compounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Australian Government currently lists the koala as a priority species for conservation status assessment.    Government estimates of the national koala population numbers in the hundreds of thousands, although other studies have estimated as few as 80,000 koalas left in the wild.    The Australian Koala Foundation estimates there are around 100,000 koalas left in the wild.\\n\\nThe IUCN lists the species as \"Least Concern\".  The Australian government does not consider the species to be threatened, although the US government has declared the koala a threatened species.\\n\\nThe koala inhabits four Australian states. Under state legislation, the species is listed as:\\n\\n*Queensland — Common, or \"Least Concern Wildlife\" throughout the state, except in the South East Queensland bioregion, where it is listed as vulnerable.   \\n*New South Wales — listed at a state scale as vulnerable, but varying regionally from secure to locally extinct.    \\n*South Australia — classified as rare.   \\n*Victoria — The koala population in Victoria was considered large and thriving, according to an article which was last reviewed on 29 October, 2007.\\n\\nThe koala was hunted almost to extinction in the early 20th century,    largely for its fur. Millions of furs were traded to Europe and the United States, and the population has not fully recovered from such decimations. Extensive cullings occurred in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919 when over one million koalas were killed with guns, poisons, and nooses.    The public outcry over the cullings was most likely the first wide-scale environmental issue that rallied Australians.  Despite the growing movement to protect native species, the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926–28 led to another 600,000 koalas being killed during a one-month open season in August 1927.\\n\\nToday, habitat loss and the impacts of urbanisation (such as dog attacks and traffic accidents) are the leading threats to the survival of the koala. In recent years, some colonies have been hard hit by disease, especially chlamydia.  Koalas \\'extinct within 30 years\\' after chlamydia outbreak, by Bonnie Malkin, The Telegraph, 10 Nov 2009  The koala requires large areas of healthy, connected forest and will travel long distances along tree corridors in search of new territory and mates. The increasing human population of the coastal parts of the continent continues to cut these corridors by agricultural and residential development, forestry, and road-building, marooning koala colonies in decreasing areas of bush. The long term viability of the koala is therefore threatened by genetic weakness  . The Australian Koala Foundation is the principal organisation dedicated to the conservation of the koala and its habitat, mapping   of land for koala habitat and claiming strong evidence that wild koala populations are in serious decline throughout the species natural range.\\n\\nAlthough the species covers a large area, only \\'pieces\\' of koala habitat remain. Presently, many habitats are lost to weeds, clearance for agriculture, or carved up by developers. Other threats come from logging, poor management, attacks from feral and domestic animals, diseases, and roads.\\n\\nIn contrast to the situation on much of the mainland, where populations are declining,  koalas, like many other species, can overrun smaller islands or isolated regions where they have been introduced.    On Kangaroo Island in South Australia, koalas introduced some 90 years ago have thrived in the absence of predators and competition. Combined with an inability to migrate to new areas, this has caused the koala populations to become unsustainable and threaten the island\\'s unique ecology. In particular, species of Manna Gum, native to the island, are being stripped by koalas at a rate faster than they can regenerate, endangering local birds and invertebrates that rely on them, and causing the extinction of at least one isolated population of manna. Koala numbers are estimated at over 30,000 , with ecologists suggesting that the island can sustain 10,000 at most . Although culling has been suggested as a means to reduce koala numbers, with the South Australian government seriously considering such in 1996, this has met with fierce opposition both domestically and internationally, and the species remains protected. The popularity of the koala has made the possibility of a cull politically improbable, with any negative perception likely to impact tourism and a government\\'s electability. In place of a cull, sterilization and relocation programs have had only limited success in reducing numbers thus far, and remain expensive. There is evidence that koalas relocated to the mainland have difficulty establishing themselves in the different circumstances. A mooted alternative to the complex sterilization method, wherein the animal must first be captured, are hormonal implants that can be injected via darts.\\n\\nAs with most native Australian animals, the koala cannot legally be kept as a pet in Australia or anywhere else. The only people who are permitted to keep koalas are wildlife carers and, occasionally, research scientists. These individuals are issued with special permits to care for koalas, but have to return them to the wild when they are either well enough or, in the case of joeys, old enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Fauna of Australia\\n*Koala emblems and popular culture\\n*List of monotremes and marsupials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*  Australian Koala Foundation\\n*  Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary\\n*  The Koala\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPierre-Auguste_Renoir\\n\\n\\n\\nPierre-Auguste Renoir (February 25, 1841 December 3, 1919) was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. As a celebrator of beauty, and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau\". \\n\\n\\n\\nPierre-Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France, the child of a working class family. As a boy, he worked in a porcelain factory where his drawing talents led to him being chosen to paint designs on fine china. He also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans before he enrolled in art school. During those early years, he often visited the Louvre to study the French master painters.\\n\\nThe Theater Box, 1874 by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Courtauld Institute Galleries, London\\nIn 1862 he began studying art under Charles Gleyre in Paris. There he met Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, and Claude Monet. At times during the 1860s, he did not have enough money to buy paint. Although Renoir first started exhibiting paintings at the Paris Salon in 1864, recognition did not come for another ten years, due, in part, to the turmoil of the Franco-Prussian War.\\n\\nDuring the Paris Commune in 1871, while he painted on the banks of the Seine River, some members of a commune group thought he was a spy, and were about to throw him into the river when a commune leader, Raoul Rigault, recognized Renoir as the man who had protected him on an earlier occasion. Different and less life-threatening versions are offered by Paul Valéry and Vollard. In all accounts, however, their re-acquaintance led to great celebration.\\n\\nIn 1874, a ten-year friendship with Jules Le Coeur and his family ended, and Renoir lost not only the valuable support gained by the association, but a generous welcome to stay on their property near Fontainebleau and its scenic forest.\\nThis loss of a favorite painting location resulted in a distinct change of subjects.\\n\\n\\n\\nRenoir experienced his initial acclaim when six of his paintings hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. In the same year two of his works were shown with Durand-Ruel in London.\\n\\nThe Swing (La Balançoire), 1876, oil on canvas, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris\\n\\nIn 1881, he traveled to Algeria, a country he associated with Eugène Delacroix, then to Madrid, to see the work of Diego Velázquez. Following that he traveled to Italy to see Titian\\'s masterpieces in Florence and the paintings of Raphael in Rome. On January 15, 1882 Renoir met the composer Richard Wagner at his home in Palermo, Sicily. Renoir painted Wagner\\'s portrait in just thirty-five minutes. In the same year, Renoir convalesced for six weeks in Algeria after contracting pneumonia, which would cause permanent damage to his respiratory system. \\n\\nIn 1883, he spent the summer in Guernsey, creating fifteen paintings in little over a month. Most of these feature Moulin Huet, a bay in Saint Martin\\'s, Guernsey. Guernsey is one of the Channel Islands in the English Channel, and it has a varied landscape which includes beaches, cliffs, bays, forests, and mountains. These paintings were the subject of a set of commemorative postage stamps issued by the Bailiwick of Guernsey in 1983.\\n\\nWhile living and working in Montmartre, Renoir employed as a model Suzanne Valadon, who posed for him (The Bathers, 1885–87; Dance at Bougival, 1883 and many of his fellow painters while studying their techniques; eventually she became one of the leading painters of the day.\\n\\nIn 1887, a year when Queen Victoria celebrated her Golden Jubilee, and upon the request of the queen\\'s associate, Phillip Richbourg, he donated several paintings to the \"French Impressionist Paintings\" catalog as a token of his loyalty.\\n\\nIn 1890 he married Aline Victorine Charigot, who, along with a number of the artist\\'s friends, had already served as a model for Les Déjeuner des canotiers (Luncheon of the Boating Party, 1881), and with whom he already had a child, Pierre, in 1885.  After his marriage Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life, including their children and their nurse, Aline\\'s cousin Gabrielle Renard. The Renoirs had three sons, one of whom, Jean, became a filmmaker of note and another, Pierre, became a stage and film actor.\\n\\nGirls at the Piano, 1892, by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris.\\n\\n\\n\\nAround 1892, Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of \"Les Collettes,\" a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life, even when arthritis severely limited his movement, and he was wheelchair-bound. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder, requiring him to adapt his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand. The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.\\n\\nDuring this period he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, Richard Guino, who worked the clay. Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to facilitate painting large works with his limited joint mobility.\\n\\nIn 1919, Renoir visited the Louvre to see his paintings hanging with the old masters. He died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-Côte d\\'Azur, on December 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n250px\\n\\nRenoir\\'s paintings are notable for their vibrant light and saturated color, most often focusing on people in intimate and candid compositions. The female nude was one of his primary subjects. In characteristic Impressionist style, Renoir suggested the details of a scene through freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings.\\n\\nHis initial paintings show the influence of the colorism of Eugène Delacroix and the luminosity of Camille Corot. He also admired the realism of Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet, and his early work resembles theirs in his use of black as a color. As well, Renoir admired Edgar Degas\\' sense of movement. Another painter Renoir greatly admired was the 18th century master François Boucher. \\n\\nA fine example of Renoir\\'s early work, and evidence of the influence of Courbet\\'s realism, is Diana, 1867. Ostensibly a mythological subject, the painting is a naturalistic studio work, the figure carefully observed, solidly modeled, and superimposed upon a contrived landscape. If the work is still a \\'student\\' piece, already Renoir\\'s heightened personal response to female sensuality is present. The model was Lise Tréhot, then the artist\\'s mistress and inspiration for a number of paintings. \\n\\nIn the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water en plein air (in the open air), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet, working side-by-side, depicted the same scenes (La Grenouillère, 1869). \\n\\nOne of the best known Impressionist works is Renoir\\'s 1876 Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (Bal du moulin de la Galette). The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people, at a popular dance garden on the Butte Montmartre, close to where he lived.\\nOn the Terrace, oil on canvas, 1881, Art Institute of Chicago\\nThe works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling colour and light. By the mid 1880s, however, he had broken with the movement to apply a more disciplined, formal technique to portraits and figure paintings, particularly of women, such as The Bathers, which was created during 1884–87. It was a trip to Italy in 1881, when he saw works by Raphael and other Renaissance masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path, and for the next several years he painted in a more severe style, in an attempt to return to classicism. This is sometimes called his \"Ingres period\", as he concentrated on his drawing and emphasized the outlines of figures. Asked late in life if he felt an affinity to Ingres, he responded: \"I should very much like to\". \\n\\nAfter 1890, however, he changed direction again, returning to the use of thinly brushed color which dissolved outlines as in his earlier work. From this period onward he concentrated especially on monumental nudes and domestic scenes, fine examples of which are Girls at the Piano, 1892, and Grandes Baigneuses, 1918–19. The latter painting is the most typical and successful of Renoir\\'s late, abundantly fleshed nudes. \" For me, Renoir becomes a really great artist in the late nudes, above all in Les Grandes Baigneuses\". \\n\\nA prolific artist, he made several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir\\'s style made his paintings some of the most well-known and frequently-reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works—181 paintings in all—is at the Barnes Foundation, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1919, Ambroise Vollard, a renowned art dealer, published a book on the life and work of Renoir, La Vie et Oeuvre de Pierre Auguste Renoir, in an edition of 1000 copies. In 1986, Vollard\\'s heirs started reprinting the copper plates, generally etchings with hand applied watercolor. These prints are signed by Renoir in the plate and are embossed “Vollard” in the lower margin.

Octopuses have two eyes and four pairs of arms and like other cephalopods are bilaterally symmetric. An octopus has a hard beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. Most octopuses have no internal or external skeleton, allowing them to squeeze through tight places. Octopuses are highly intelligent, probably the most intelligent of all invertebrates.\\n\\nThe octopus inhabits many diverse regions of the ocean, especially coral reefs. For defense against predators, they hide, flee quickly, expel ink, or use color-changing camouflage. An octopus trails its eight arms behind it as it swims. All octopuses are venomous, but only the small blue-ringed octopuses are deadly to humans.  Unimelb.edu.au, Tentacles of venom: new study reveals all octopuses are venomous, University of Melbourne, Media Release, Wednesday 15 April 2009\\n\\nIn the larger sense, there are around 300 recognized octopus species, which is over one-third of the total number of known cephalopod species. The term octopus may also be used to refer only to those creatures in the genus Octopus. \\n\\n\\nA Common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris)\\nOctopuses are characterized by their eight arms, usually bearing suction cups. The arms of octopuses are often distinguished from the pair of feeding tentacles found in squid and cuttlefish. Norman, M. 2000. Cephalopods: A World Guide. ConchBooks, Hackenheim. p. 15. \"There is some confusion around the terms arms versus tentacles. The numerous limbs of nautiluses are called tentacles. The ring of eight limbs around the mouth in cuttlefish, squids and octopuses are called arms. Cuttlefish and squid also have a pair of specialised limbs attached between the bases of the third and fourth arm pairs [...]. These are known as feeding tentacles and are used to shoot out and grab prey.\"  Both types of limbs are muscular hydrostats. Unlike most other cephalopods, the majority of octopuses   those in the suborder most commonly known, Incirrina   have almost entirely soft bodies with no internal skeleton. They have neither a protective outer shell like the nautilus, nor any vestige of an internal shell or bones, like cuttlefish or squid. A beak, similar in shape to a parrot\\'s beak, is the only hard part of their body. This enables them to squeeze through very narrow slits between underwater rocks, which is very helpful when they are fleeing from morays or other predatory fish. The octopuses in the less familiar Cirrina suborder have two fins and an internal shell, generally reducing their ability to squeeze into small spaces.\\n\\nAn octopus moving between tide pools during low tide\\n\\nOctopuses have a relatively short life expectancy, and some species live for as little as six months. Larger species, such as the North Pacific Giant Octopus, may live for up to five years under suitable circumstances. However, reproduction is a cause of death: males can only live for a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. They neglect to eat during the (roughly) one month period spent taking care of their unhatched eggs, but they don\\'t die of starvation.  Endocrine secretions from the two optic glands are the cause of genetically-programmed death (and if these glands are surgically removed, the octopus may live many months beyond reproduction, until she finally starves).\\n\\nStauroteuthis syrtensis, a finned octopus of the suborder Cirrina\\n\\nOctopuses have three hearts. Two pump blood through each of the two gills, while the third pumps blood through the body. Octopus blood contains the copper-rich protein hemocyanin for transporting oxygen. Although less efficient under normal conditions than the iron-rich hemoglobin of vertebrates, in cold conditions with low oxygen pressure, hemocyanin oxygen transportation is more efficient than hemoglobin oxygen transportation. The hemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within red blood cells and gives the blood a blue color. Octopuses draw water into their mantle cavity where it passes through its gills. As mollusks, octopuses have gills that are finely divided and vascularized outgrowths of either the outer or the inner body surface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOctopuses are highly intelligent, likely more so than any other order of invertebrates. The exact extent of their intelligence and learning capability is much debated among biologists,    NFW.org?, Is the octopus really the invertebrate intellect of the sea, by Doug Stewart. In: National Wildlife. Feb/Mar 1997, vol.35 no.2.\\n   Giant Octopus—Mighty but Secretive Denizen of the Deep   Slate.com, How Smart is the Octopus?  but maze and problem-solving experiments have shown that they do have both short- and long-term memory. Their short lifespans limit the amount they can ultimately learn. There has been much speculation to the effect that almost all octopus behaviors are independently learned rather than instinct-based, although this remains largely unproven. They learn almost no behaviors from their parents, with whom young octopuses have very little contact.\\n\\nAn octopus opening a container with a screw cap\\n\\nAn octopus has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is localized in its brain.  Two-thirds of an octopus\\'s neurons are found in the nerve cords of its arms, which have a remarkable amount of autonomy.  Octopus arms show a wide variety of complex reflex actions arising on at least three different levels of the nervous system. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses in their higher brain are not organized using an internal somatotopic map of its body. Zullo L, Sumbre G, Agnisola C, Flash T, Hochner B. (2009). Nonsomatotopic organization of the higher motor centers in octopus.\\nCurr Biol. 19(19):1632-6.  PMID 19765993  Some octopuses, such as the Mimic Octopus, will move their arms in ways that emulate the movements of other sea creatures.\\n\\nIn laboratory experiments, octopuses can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns.  They have been reported to practice observational learning,  Octopus intelligence: jar opening  although the validity of these findings is widely contested on a number of grounds.  What is this octopus thinking?. By Garry Hamilton.   Octopuses have also been observed in what some have described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them.  What behavior can we expect of octopuses?. By Dr. Jennifer Mather, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge and Roland C. Anderson, The Seattle Aquarium.  Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs.\\n\\nIn some countries, octopuses are on the list of experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anesthesia. In the UK, cephalopods such as octopuses are regarded as honorary vertebrates under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and other cruelty to animals legislation, extending to them protections not normally afforded to invertebrates.  United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) act of 1986\\n\\nThe octopus is the only invertebrate which has been conclusively shown to use tools. At least four specimens of the Veined Octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) have been witnessed retrieving discarded coconut shells, manipulating them, and then reassembling them to use as shelter. This discovery was documented in the journal Current Biology and has also been caught on video.  /ref>  /ref>\\n\\n\\n\\nGreater Blue-ringed Octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata)\\nAn octopus\\'s main (primary) defense is to hide, either not to be seen at all, or not to be detected as an octopus. Hanlon, R.T. & J.B. Messenger 1996. Cephalopod Behaviour. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.  Octopuses have several secondary defenses (defenses they use once they have been seen by a predator).  The most common secondary defense is fast escape. Other defenses include the use of ink sacs, camouflage, and autotomising limbs.\\n\\nMost octopuses can eject a thick blackish ink in a large cloud to aid in escaping from predators.  The main colouring agent of the ink is melanin, which is the same chemical that gives humans their hair and skin colour. This ink cloud is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid an octopus\\'s evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might serve as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead. Caldwell, R. L. (2005). \"An Observation of Inking Behavior Protecting Adult Octopus bocki from Predation by Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) Hatchlings.\" Pacific Science 59(1): 69–72.\\n\\nThis small octopus species travels with shells it has collected for protection.\\n\\nAn octopus\\'s camouflage is aided by certain specialized skin cells which can change the apparent color, opacity, and reflectiveness of the epidermis.  Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colors, while some have two or four. Other color-changing cells are reflective iridophores, and leucophores (white).    This color-changing ability can also be used to communicate with or warn other octopuses. The very venomous blue-ringed octopus becomes bright yellow with blue rings when it is provoked.  Octopuses can use muscles in the skin to change the texture of their mantle in order to achieve a greater camouflage.  In some species the mantle can take on the spiky appearance of seaweed, or the scraggly, bumpy texture of a rock, among other disguises.  However in some species skin anatomy is limited to relatively patternless shades of one color, and limited skin texture.  It is thought that octopuses that are day-active and/or live in complex habitats such as coral reefs have evolved more complex skin than their nocturnal and/or sand-dwelling relatives.\\n\\nWhen under attack, some octopuses can perform arm autotomy, in a similar manner to the way skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The crawling arm serves as a distraction to would-be predators.\\n\\nA few species, such as the Mimic Octopus, have a fourth defense mechanism. They can combine their highly flexible bodies with their color changing ability to accurately mimic other, more dangerous animals such as lionfish, sea snakes, and eels. Norman, M.D., J. Finn & T. Tregenza (2001).   Proceedings of the Royal Society 268: 1755–1758.  Norman, M.D. & F.G.Hochberg (2005). The \"Mimic Octopus\" (Thaumoctopus mimicus n. gen. et sp.), a new octopus from the tropical Indo-West Pacific (Cephalopoda: Octopodidae). Molluscan Research 25: 57–70.  Abstract \\n  /ref>-->\\n\\n\\nWhen octopuses reproduce, males use a specialized arm called a hectocotylus to insert spermatophores (packets of sperm) into the female\\'s mantle cavity. The hectocotylus in benthic octopuses is usually the third right arm. Males die within a few months of mating. In some species, the female octopus can keep the sperm alive inside her for weeks until her eggs are mature. After they have been fertilized, the female lays about 200,000 eggs (this figure dramatically varies between families, genera, species and also individuals). The female hangs these eggs in strings from the ceiling of her lair, or individually attaches them to the substrate depending on the species. The female cares for the eggs, guarding them against predators, and gently blowing currents of water over them so that they get enough oxygen. The female does not hunt during the roughly one-month period spent taking care of the unhatched eggs and may ingest some of her own arms for sustenance. At around the time the eggs hatch, the mother leaves the lair and is too weak to defend herself from predators like cod, often succumbing to their attacks. The young larval octopuses spend a period of time drifting in clouds of plankton, where they feed on copepods, larval crabs and larval starfish until they are ready to descend to the ocean bottom, where the cycle repeats. This is a dangerous time for the larval octopuses; in the plankton cloud they are vulnerable to plankton eaters. In some deeper dwelling species, the young do not go through this period.\\n\\n\\n\\nEye of Octopus vulgaris\\nOctopuses have keen eyesight. Octopuses, like other cephalopods, can distinguish the polarization of light.  Color vision appears to vary from species to species, being present in  Octopus aegina  but absent in  Octopus vulgaris  Kawamura, G., et al. (2001).   . Nippon Suisan Gakkashi 67(1): 35–39. .  Attached to the brain are two special organs, called statocysts, that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body relative to horizontal.  An autonomic response keeps the octopus\\'s eyes oriented so that the pupil slit is always horizontal.\\n\\nOctopuses also have an excellent sense of touch.  An octopus\\'s suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so that the octopus can taste what it is touching.  The arms contain tension sensors so that the octopus knows whether its arms are stretched out.  However, the octopus has a very poor proprioceptive sense.  The tension receptors are not sufficient for the octopus brain to determine the position of the octopus\\'s body or arms.  (It is not clear that the octopus brain would be capable of processing the large amount of information that this would require; the flexibility of an octopus\\'s arms is much greater than that of the limbs of vertebrates, which devote large areas of cerebral cortex to the processing of proprioceptive inputs.) As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling.  It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. Wells. Martin John.  Octopus: physiology and behaviour of an advanced invertebrate.  London : Chapman and Hall ; New York : distributed in the U.S.A. by Halsted Press, 1978.\\n\\nThe neurological autonomy of the arms means that the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions.  The brain may issue a high-level command to the arms, but the nerve cords in the arms execute the details.  There is no neurological path for the brain to receive feedback about just how its command was executed by the arms; the only way it knows just what motions were made is by observing the arms visually.\\n\\nOctopuses swim headfirst, with arms trailing behind\\n\\n\\n\\nOctopuses move about by crawling or swimming. Their main means of slow travel is crawling, with some swimming. Jet propulsion is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and walking.  Locomotion by Abdopus aculeatus, C.L. Huffard 2006\\n\\nThey crawl by walking on their arms, usually on many at once, on both solid and soft surfaces, while supported in water. In 2005 it was reported that some octopuses (Adopus aculeatus and Amphioctopus marginatus under current taxonomy) can walk on two arms, while at the same time resembling plant matter.  Science, vol. 307, p. 1927  This form of locomotion allows these octopuses to move quickly away from a potential predator while possibly not triggering that predator\\'s search image for octopus (food).  Octopuses lack bones and are extremely vulnerable to predators.\\n\\nOctopuses swim by expelling a jet of water from a contractile mantle, and aiming it via a muscular siphon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn adult North Pacific Giant Octopus, Enteroctopus dofleini\\nThe North Pacific Giant Octopus, Enteroctopus dofleini, is often cited as the largest octopus species. Adults usually weigh around 15 kg (33 lb), with an arm span of up to 4.3 m (14 ft).  Smithsonian National Zoological Park: Giant Pacific Octopus  The largest specimen of this species to be scientifically documented was an animal with a live mass of 71 kg (156.5 lb). Cosgrove, J.A. 1987. Aspects of the Natural History of Octopus dofleini, the Giant Pacific Octopus. M.Sc. Thesis. Department of Biology, University of Victoria (Canada), 101 pp.  The alternative contender is the Seven-arm Octopus, Haliphron atlanticus, based on a 61 kg (134 lb) carcass estimated to have a live mass of 75 kg (165 lb).

However, there are a number of questionable size records that would suggest E. dofleini is the largest of all octopus species by a considerable margin; Norman, M. 2000. Cephalopods: A World Guide.

Similarly, a live octopus may be sliced up and the legs eaten while still squirming, which continues for some minutes.\\n\\nalt=Photo of captured octopus and polespear\\n\\nOctopus is eaten regularly in Hawaii, since many popular dishes are Asian in origin. Locally known by their Hawaiian or Japanese names, (\"he\\'e\" and \"tako\" respectively) octopus is also a popular fish bait.\\n\\nOctopus is a common food in Mediterranean cuisine and Portuguese cuisine. In Galicia, polbo á feira (market fair style octopus) is a local delicacy.  Restaurants which specialize or serve this dish are known as pulperías. On the Tunisian island of Djerba, local people catch octopuses by taking advantage of the animals\\' habit of hiding in safe places during the night. In the evening they put grey ceramic pots on the sea bed. The morning of the following day they check them for octopuses that sheltered there.\\n\\nAccording to the USDA Nutrient Database (2007), cooked octopus contains approximately 139 calories per three ounce portion, and is a source of vitamin B3, B12, potassium, phosphorus, and selenium.  Octopus Calories And Nutrition\\n\\nCare must be taken to boil the octopus properly, to rid it of slime, smell, and residual ink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough octopuses can be difficult to keep in captivity, some people keep them as pets. Octopuses often escape even from supposedly secure tanks, due to their problem solving skills, mobility and lack of rigid structure.\\n\\nThe variation in size and life span among octopus species makes it difficult to know how long a new specimen can naturally be expected to live. That is, a small octopus may be just born or may be an adult, depending on its species. By selecting a well-known species, such as the California Two-spot Octopus, one can choose a small octopus (around the size of a tennis ball) and be confident that it is young with a full life ahead of it.\\n\\nOctopuses are also quite strong for their size. Octopuses kept as pets have been known to open the covers of their aquariums and survive for a time in the air in order to get to a nearby feeder tank and gorge themselves on the fish there.

Kangaroos are endemic to the continent of Australia, while the smaller macropods are found in Australia and New Guinea.\\n\\nIn general, larger kangaroos have adapted much better to changes wrought to the Australian landscape by humans and though many of their smaller cousins are endangered, they are plentiful. They are not farmed to any extent, but wild kangaroos are shot for meat, over which there is controversy.  Steve Dow: \"An industry that\\'s under the gun\".

The name was first recorded as \"Kangooroo or Kanguru\" on 4 August,1770, by Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook on the banks of the Endeavour River at the site of modern Cooktown, when HM Bark Endeavour was beached for almost seven weeks to repair damage sustained on the Great Barrier Reef.\\n\\nA common myth about the kangaroo\\'s English name is that it came from the Aboriginal words for \"I don\\'t understand you.\" According to this legend, Captain James Cook and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks were exploring Australia when they happened upon the animal. They asked a nearby local what the creatures were called. The local responded \"Kangaroo\", meaning \"I don\\'t understand you\", which Cook took to be the name of the creature.  Tour lecture,  , Dawsonville, GA. \\nKangaroo soon became adopted into standard English where it has come to mean any member of the family of kangaroos and wallabies.  Male kangaroos are called bucks, boomers, jacks, or old men; females are does, flyers, or jills, and the young ones are joeys.  Animal Bytes: Kangaroo and Wallaby URL accessed January 7, 2007.  The collective noun for kangaroos is a mob, troop, or court. Kangaroos are sometimes colloquially referred to as roos.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Tasmanian Forester (Eastern Grey) Kangaroo in motion.\\nThere are four species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos:\\n* The Red Kangaroo (Macropus rufus) is the largest surviving marsupial anywhere in the world. Fewer in numbers, the Red Kangaroo occupies the arid and semi-arid centre of the continent. A large male can be 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).   \\n* The Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is less well-known than the red (outside of Australia), but the most often seen, as its range covers the fertile eastern part of the continent. \\n* The Western Grey Kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) is slightly smaller again at about 54 kg (119 lb) for a large male. It is found in the southern part of Western Australia, South Australia near the coast, and the Darling River basin.\\n* The Antilopine Kangaroo (Macropus antilopinus) is, essentially, the far-northern equivalent of the Eastern and Western Grey Kangaroos. Like them, it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious.\\n\\nIn addition, there are about 50 smaller macropods closely related to the kangaroo in the family Macropodidae.\\n\\n\\n\\nRed Kangaroo (Macropus rufus)\\nEuropeans have long regarded Kangaroos as strange animals. Early explorers described them as creatures that had heads like deer (without antlers), stood upright like men, and hopped like frogs.  Combined with the two-headed appearance of a mother kangaroo, this led many back home to dismiss them as travellers\\' tales for quite some time.\\n\\nKangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like all marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for Red Kangaroo is about 20 25 km/h (13 16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained, over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for  nearly two kilometres.    This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators.\\n\\nBecause of its long feet, it cannot walk correctly. To move at slow speeds, it uses its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs. It then raises its hind feet forward, in a form of locomotion called \"crawl-walking.\"\\n\\nThe average life expectancy of a kangaroo is about 4 6 years.\\n\\n\\n\\nDifferent species of kangaroos eat different diets.  Eastern grey kangaroos are predominantly grazers eating a wide variety of grasses whereas some other species (e.g. red kangaroos and swamp wallabies) include significant amounts of shrubs in the diet. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi.  Many species are nocturnal  Archives URL accessed January 7, 2007.  and crepuscular,  Columbus Zoo article URL accessed January 7, 2007.  usually spending the days resting in shade and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.\\n\\nBecause of its grazing, kangaroos have developed specialized teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back.\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite having a herbivorous diet similar to ruminants such as cattle which release large quantities of methane through exhaling and eructation, kangaroos release virtually none. The hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy. Scientists are interested in the possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible from kangaroos to cattle, since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times greater than that of carbon dioxide.  Radio Australia - Innovations: \\n\"Methane In Agriculture.\" 15 August  2004. Retrieved 28 August 2007.\\n\\n\\n\\nKangaroos have few natural predators. The Thylacine, considered by palaeontologists to have once been a major natural predator of the kangaroo, is now extinct. Other extinct predators included the Marsupial Lion, Megalania and the Wonambi. However, with the arrival of humans in Australia at least 50,000 years ago and the introduction of the dingo about 5,000 years ago, kangaroos have had to adapt.   The mere barking of a dog can set a full-grown male boomer into a wild frenzy.   Wedge-tailed Eagles and other raptors usually eat kangaroo carrion. Goannas and other carnivorous reptiles also pose a danger to smaller kangaroo species when other food sources are lacking.\\n\\nAlong with dingos and other canids, introduced species like foxes and feral cats also pose a threat to kangaroo populations. Kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if presented with the option. If pursued into the water, a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.  Canadian Museum of Nature - Kangaroo URL accessed January 6, 2007.  Another defensive tactic described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog  with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs.\\n\\n\\n\\nNewborn joey sucking on a teat in the pouch\\nKangaroos have developed a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile continent and highly variable climate. As with all marsupials, the young are born at a very early stage of development   after a gestation of 31 36 days. At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat. In comparison, a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive. The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180 320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time. It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months.\\n\\nThe female kangaroo is usually pregnant in permanence, except on the day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch. This is known as diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources.  The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. In addition, the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch.\\n\\nUnusually, during a dry period, males will not produce sperm, and females will only conceive if there has been enough rain to produce a large quantity of green vegetation.\\n\\nHindleg of a kangaroo Kangaroos and wallabies have large, stretchy  tendons in their hind legs. They store elastic strain energy in the tendons of their large hind legs, providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort. This is true in all animal species which have muscles connected to their skeleton through elastic elements such as tendons, but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos.\\n\\nThere is also a link between the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is expelled from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated that, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and that the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly-sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other continents but economy: in an infertile continent with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.\\n\\nA sequencing project of the Kangaroo genome was started in 2004 as a collaboration between Australia (mainly funded by the state of Victoria) and the National Institutes of Health in the US.  Kangaroo hops in line for genome sequencing URL accessed January 6, 2007.  The genome of a marsupial such as the kangaroo is of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans: mice are too close and haven\\'t developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote. The dairy industry has also expressed some interest in this project.\\n\\n\\n\\nEye disease  is rare but not new among kangaroos.  The first official report of kangaroo blindness took place in 1994, in central New South Wales.  The following year, reports of blind kangaroos appeared in Victoria and South Australia.  By 1996, the disease had spread \"across the desert to Western Australia\".  Australian authorities were concerned that the disease could spread to other livestock and possibly humans.  Researchers at the Australian Animal Health Laboratories in Geelong detected a virus called the Wallal virus in two species of midge, believed to have been the carriers.       Veterinarians also discovered that less than three percent of kangaroos exposed to the virus developed blindness.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore European settlement, the kangaroo was a very important animal for Australian Aborigines, for its meat, hide, bones and sinews. In addition, there were important Dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the kangaroo.  Aherrenge is a current kangaroo dreaming site in the Northern Territory. The game of Marn grook was played using a ball made from kangaroo  by the Kurnai people.\\n\\nUnlike many of the smaller macropods, kangaroos have fared well since European settlement. European settlers cut down forests to create vast grasslands for sheep and cattle grazing, added stock watering points in arid areas, and have substantially reduced the number of dingoes.\\n\\nKangaroos are shy and retiring by nature, and in normal circumstances present no threat to humans. Male kangaroos often \"box\" amongst each other, playfully, for dominance, or in competition for mates. The dexterity of their forepaws is utilised in both punching and grappling with the foe, but the real danger lies in a serious kick with the hindleg. The sharpened toenails can disembowel an opponent.\\n\\nThere are very few records of kangaroos attacking humans without provocation, however several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a rabies-like disease possibly affecting the marsupials. The only reliably documented case of a fatality from a kangaroo attack occurred in New South Wales, in 1936. A hunter was killed when he tried to rescue his two dogs from a heated fray. Other suggested causes for erratic and dangerous kangaroo behaviour include extreme thirst and hunger.\\n\\nIn 2003, Lulu, an Eastern Grey, saved a farmer\\'s life.  She received the RSPCA National Animal Valor Award on May 19 of the next year.\\n\\n\\n\\nA \"kangaroo crossing\" sign on an Australian highway.\\nA kangaroo crossing a highway.\\nA collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo. Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise have been known to leap in front of cars.  Since kangaroos in mid-bound can reach speeds of around 50 km/h (31 mph) and are relatively heavy, the force of impact can be severe.  Small vehicles may be destroyed, while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage. The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact.  As a result, \"kangaroo crossing\" signs are commonplace in Australia.\\n\\nVehicles that frequent isolated roads, where roadside assistance may be scarce, are often fitted with \"roo bars\" to minimise damage caused by collision. Bonnet-mounted devices, designed to scare wildlife off the road with ultrasound and other methods, have been devised and marketed.\\n\\nIf a female is the victim of a collision, animal welfare groups ask that her pouch be checked for any surviving joey, in which case it may be removed to a wildlife sanctuary or veterinary surgeon for rehabilitation.  Likewise, when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision, a vet, the RSPCA or the National Parks and Wildlife Service can be consulted for instructions on proper care. In New South Wales, rehabilitation of kangaroos is carried out by volunteers from WIRES.\\n\\n\\n\\nOccasionally, individuals take on the task of rearing a recovered joey themselves. The rule-of-thumb says that if the joey is already covered with fur at the time of the accident (as opposed to still being in its embryonic stage), it stands a good chance of growing up properly. Lactose-free milk is required, otherwise the animal may develop blindness. They hop readily into a cloth bag when it is lowered in front of them approximately to the height where the mother\\'s pouch would be. The joey\\'s instinct is to \"cuddle up\", thereby endearing themselves to their keepers, but after hand-rearing a joey, it cannot usually be released into the wild and be expected to provide for itself immediately. Usually wildlife sanctuaries are willing to adopt kangaroos which are no longer practical, or have grown too large to contain, needing at least 1 acre and 7ft boundary fences for a fully grown kangaroo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKangaroos have been featured on coins, as well as being used as emblems and logos. They have also been used as mascots and in the naming of sports teams and are extremely well-represented in films, television, toys and souvenirs around the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Dawson, Terence J. 1995.

His works enjoy a broad popular appeal in the United States, where Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life scenarios he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine over more than four decades. Among the best-known of Rockwell\\'s works are the Willie Gillis series, Rosie the Riveter (although his Rosie was reproduced less than others of the day), Saying Grace (1951), and the Four Freedoms series. He is also noted for his work for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA); producing covers for their publication Boys\\' Life, calendars, and other illustrations.\\n\\n\\n\\nNorman Rockwell was born on February 3, 1894, in New York City to Jarvis Waring and Ann Mary Rockwell.\\n\\nHe had one brother, Jarvis Rockwell. Norman transferred from high school to the Chase Art School at the age of 14. He then went on to the National Academy of Design and finally to the Art Students League. There, he was taught by Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent Dumond; his early works were produced for St. Nicholas Magazine, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) publication Boys\\' Life and other juvenile publications. Joseph Csatari carried on his legacy and style for the BSA.\\n\\nAs a student, Rockwell was given smaller, less important jobs. His first major breakthrough came in 1912 at age eighteen with his first book illustration for Carl H. Claudy\\'s Tell Me Why: Stories about Mother Nature.\\n\\nIn 1913, the nineteen-year old Rockwell became the art editor for Boys\\' Life, published by the Boy Scouts of America, a post he held for three years (1913 1916). As part of that position, he painted several covers, beginning with his first published magazine cover, Scout at Ship\\'s Wheel, appearing on the Boys\\' Life September 1913 edition.\\nScout at Ship\\'s Wheel, 1913\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the First World War, he tried to enlist into the U.S. Navy but was refused entry because, at 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and 140 pounds (64 kg), he was eight pounds underweight. To compensate, he spent one night gorging himself on bananas, liquids and doughnuts, and weighed enough to enlist the next day. However, he was given the role of a military artist and did not see any action during his tour of duty.\\nFreedom of Speech\\nRockwell\\'s family moved to New Rochelle, New York at age 21 and shared a studio with the cartoonist Clyde Forsythe, who worked for The Saturday Evening Post. With Forsythe\\'s help, he submitted his first successful cover painting to the Post in 1916, Mother\\'s Day Off (published on May 20). He followed that success with Circus Barker and Strongman (published on June 3), Gramps at the Plate (August 5), Redhead Loves Hatty Perkins (September 16), People in a Theatre Balcony (October 14) and Man Playing Santa (December 9). Rockwell was published eight times total on the Post cover within the first twelve months. Norman Rockwell published a total of 321 original covers for The Saturday Evening Post over 47 years.\\n\\nRockwell\\'s success on the cover of the Post led to covers for other magazines of the day, most notably The Literary Digest, The Country Gentleman, Leslie\\'s Weekly, Judge, Peoples Popular Monthly and Life Magazine.\\n\\n\\n\\nRockwell married his first wife, Irene O\\'Connor, in 1916. Irene was Rockwell\\'s model in Mother Tucking Children into Bed, published on the cover of The Literary Digest on January 19, 1921. However, the couple divorced in 1930. He quickly married schoolteacher Mary Barstow, with whom he had three children: Jarvis Waring, Thomas Rhodes and Peter Barstow. The family lived at 24 Lord Kitchener Road in the Bonnie Crest neighborhood of New Rochelle, New York. Rockwell and his wife were not very religious, although they were members of \\u200eSt. John\\'s Wilmot Church, an Episcopal church near their home, and had their sons baptized there as well. Rockwell moved to Arlington, Vermont in 1939 where his work began to reflect small-town life. In 1953, the Rockwell family moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, so that his wife could be treated at the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital at 25 Main Street, down Main Street from where Rockwell set up his studio. Rockwell himself received psychiatric treatment from the renowned analyst Eric Erikson, who was on staff at Riggs. Erikson is said to have told the artist that he painted his happiness, but did not live it. In 1959, Mary Barstow Rockwell died unexpectedly. In 1961, Rockwell married Molly Punderson, a retired teacher.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rear of Norman Rockwell\\'s preserved studio.\\nIn 1943, during the Second World War, Rockwell painted the Four Freedoms series, which was completed in seven months and resulted in his losing 15 pounds. The series was inspired by a speech by Franklin D. Roosevelt, in which he described four principles for universal rights: Freedom from Want, Freedom of Speech, Freedom to Worship, and Freedom from Fear. The paintings were published in 1943 by The Saturday Evening Post. The U.S. Treasury Department later promoted war bonds by exhibiting the originals in 16 cities. Rockwell himself considered \"Freedom of Speech\" to be the best of the four. That same year a fire in his studio destroyed numerous original paintings, costumes, and props.\\n\\nShortly after the war, Rockwell was contacted by writer Elliott Caplin, brother of cartoonist Al Capp, with the suggestion that the three of them should make a daily comic strip together, with Caplin and his brother writing and Rockwell drawing. King Features Syndicate is reported to have promised a $1,000/week deal, knowing that a Capp-Rockwell collaboration would gain strong public interest. However, the project was ultimately aborted as it turned out that Rockwell, known for his perfectionism as an artist, could not deliver material as fast as required of him for a daily comic strip. \\n\\nDuring the late 1940s, Norman Rockwell spent the winter months as artist-in-residence at Otis College of Art and Design. Students occasionally were models for his Saturday Evening Post covers. In 1949, Rockwell donated an original Post cover, \"April Fool,\" to be raffled off in a library fund raiser.\\n\\nIn 1959, his wife Mary died unexpectedly, and Rockwell took time off from his work to grieve. It was during this break that he and his son Thomas produced his autobiography, My Adventures as an Illustrator, which was published in 1960. The Post printed excerpts from this book in eight consecutive issues, the first containing Rockwell\\'s famous Triple Self-Portrait.\\n\\n\\n\\nNorman Rockwell\\nRockwell married his third wife, retired Milton Academy English teacher, Molly Punderson, in 1961. His last painting for the Post was published in 1963, marking the end of a publishing relationship that had included 322 cover paintings. He spent the next 10 years painting for Look magazine, where his work depicted his interests in civil rights, poverty and space exploration.\\n\\nDuring his long career, he was commissioned to paint the portraits for Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, as well as those of foreign figures, including Gamal Abdel Nasser and Jawaharlal Nehru. One of his last works was a portrait of legendary singer Judy Garland in 1969.\\n\\nA custodianship of 574 of his original paintings and drawings was established with Rockwell\\'s help near his home in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and the museum is still open today year round. For \"vivid and affectionate portraits of our country,\" Rockwell received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977, the United States of America\\'s highest civilian honor.\\n\\nRockwell died November 8, 1978 of emphysema at age 84 in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.  First Lady Rosalynn Carter attended his funeral.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis first Scouting calendar (1925)\\n\\nNorman Rockwell was very prolific, and produced over 4,000 original works, most of which have been either destroyed by fire or are in permanent collections. Rockwell was also commissioned to illustrate over 40 books including Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. His annual contributions for the Boy Scouts\\' calendars between 1925 and 1976 (Rockwell was a 1939 recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award, the highest adult award given by the Boy Scouts of America), were only slightly overshadowed by his most popular of calendar works: the \"Four Seasons\" illustrations for Brown & Bigelow that were published for 17 years beginning in 1947 and reproduced in various styles and sizes since 1964. Illustrations for booklets, catalogs, posters (particularly movie promotions), sheet music, stamps, playing cards, and murals (including \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" and \"God Bless the Hills\", which was completed in 1936 for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, New Jersey) rounded out Rockwell\\'s œuvre as an illustrator. \\nThe Problem We All Live With\\n\\nRockwell\\'s work was dismissed by serious art critics in his lifetime. Many of his works appear overly sweet in modern critics\\' eyes, especially the Saturday Evening Post covers, which tend toward idealistic or sentimentalized portrayals of American life---this has led to the often-deprecatory adjective \"Rockwellesque.\" Consequently, Rockwell is not considered a \"serious painter\" by some contemporary artists, who often regard his work as bourgeois and kitsch. Writer Vladimir Nabokov sneered that Rockwell\\'s brilliant technique was put to \"banal\" use, and wrote in his book Pnin: \"That Dalí is really Norman Rockwell\\'s twin brother kidnapped by Gypsies in babyhood\". He is called an \"illustrator\" instead of an artist by some critics, a designation he did not mind, as it was what he called himself. \\n\\nHowever, in his later years, Rockwell began receiving more attention as a painter when he chose more serious subjects such as the series on racism for Look magazine. One example of this more serious work is The Problem We All Live With, which dealt with the issue of school integration. The painting depicts a young African American girl, Ruby Bridges, flanked by white federal marshals, walking to school past a wall defaced by racist graffiti.\\n\\nIn 1999, The New Yorker art critic Peter Schjeldahl said of Rockwell in ArtNews: “Rockwell is terrific. It’s become too tedious to pretend he isn’t.”\\n\\nRockwell\\'s work was exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2001.  Norman Rockwell at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.  Rockwell\\'s Breaking Home Ties sold for $15.4 million at a 2006 Sotheby’s auction.

His major works include paintings, murals, sketches, and other art objects. Klimt\\'s primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism—nowhere is this more apparent than in his numerous drawings in pencil (see Mulher sentada, below). \\n\\n\\n\\nGustav Klimt was born in Baumgarten, near Vienna, the second of seven children   three boys and four girls. All three sons displayed artistic talent early on. His father, Ernst Klimt, formerly from Bohemia, was a gold engraver. Ernst married Anna Klimt (née Finster), whose unrealized ambition was to be a musical performer. Klimt lived in poverty for most of his childhood, as work was scarce and economic advancement was difficult for immigrants.\\n\\nIn 1876, Klimt was awarded a scholarship to the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts (Kunstgewerbeschule), where he studied until 1883, and received training as an architectural painter.  He revered the foremost history painter of the time, Hans Makart. Klimt readily accepted the principles of a conservative training; his early work may be classified as academic.  In 1877 his brother Ernst, who, like his father, would become an engraver, also enrolled in the school. The two brothers and their friend Franz Matsch began working together; by 1880 they had received numerous commissions as a team they called the \"Company of Artists\", and helped their teacher in painting murals in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.   Klimt began his professional career painting interior murals and ceilings in large public buildings on the Ringstraße including a successful series of \"Allegories and Emblems\".\\n\\nIn 1888, Klimt received the Golden order of Merit from Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria for his contributions to murals painted in the Burgtheater in Vienna.  He also became an honorary member of the University of Munich and the University of Vienna. In 1892 both Klimt\\'s father and brother Ernst died, and he had to assume financial responsibility for his father\\'s and brother\\'s families.  The tragedies affected his artistic vision as well, and soon he would veer toward a new personal style. In the early 1890s, Klimt met Emilie Flöge, who, notwithstanding the artist\\'s relationships with other women, was to be his companion until the end of his life. Whether his relationship with Flöge was sexual or not is debated, but during that period Klimt fathered at least 14 children. \\n\\n\\n\\nA section of the Beethoven Frieze\\nKlimt became one of the founding members and president of the Wiener Sezession (Vienna Secession) in 1897 and of the group\\'s periodical Ver Sacrum (Sacred Spring). He remained with the Secession until 1908. The group\\'s goals were to provide exhibitions for unconventional young artists, to bring the best foreign artists\\' works to Vienna, and to publish its own magazine to showcase members\\' work. The group declared no manifesto and did not set out to encourage any particular style -- Naturalists, Realists, and Symbolists all coexisted. The government supported their efforts and gave them a lease on public land to erect an exhibition hall. The group\\'s symbol was Pallas Athena, the Greek goddess of just causes, wisdom, and the arts—and Klimt painted his radical version in 1898.\\n\\nIn 1894, Klimt was commissioned to create three paintings to decorate the ceiling of the Great Hall in the University of Vienna. Not completed until the turn of the century, his three paintings, Philosophy, Medicine and Jurisprudence were criticized for their radical themes and material, which was called \"pornographic\". Klimt had transformed traditional allegory and symbolism into a new language which was more overtly sexual, and hence more disturbing.  The public outcry came from all quarters   political, aesthetic, and religious. As a result, they were not displayed on the ceiling of the Great Hall. This would be the last public commission accepted by the artist. All three paintings were destroyed by retreating SS forces in May 1945. His Nuda Verita (1899) defined his bid to further shake up the establishment. The starkly naked red-headed woman holds the mirror of truth, while above it is a quote by Schiller in stylized lettering, \"If you cannot please everyone with your deeds and your art, please a few. To please many is bad.\" \\n\\nIn 1902, Klimt finished the Beethoven Frieze for the 14th Vienna Secessionist exhibition, which was intended to be a celebration of the composer and featured a monumental, polychromed sculpture by Max Klinger. Meant for the exhibition only, the frieze was painted directly on the walls with light materials. After the exhibition the painting was preserved, although it did not go on display until 1986.\\n\\nDuring this period Klimt did not confine himself to public commissions. Beginning in the late 1890s he took annual summer holidays with the Flöge family on the shores of Attersee and painted many of his landscapes there. These works constitute the only genre aside from the figure that seriously interested Klimt, and are of a number and quality so as to merit a separate appreciation. Formally, the landscapes are characterized by the same refinement of design and emphatic patterning as the figural pieces. Deep space in the Attersee works is so efficiently flattened to a single plane, it is believed that Klimt painted them while looking through a telescope. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Kiss 1907–1908. Oil on canvas. Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.\\nKlimt\\'s \\'Golden Phase\\' was marked by positive critical reaction and success. Many of his paintings from this period used gold leaf; the prominent use of gold can first be traced back to Pallas Athene (1898) and Judith I (1901), although the works most popularly associated with this period are the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (1907) and The Kiss (1907 - 1908). Klimt travelled little but trips to Venice and Ravenna, both famous for their beautiful mosaics, most likely inspired his gold technique and his Byzantine imagery. In 1904, he collaborated with other artists on the lavish Palais Stoclet, the home of a wealthy Belgian industrialist, which was one of the grandest monuments of the Art Nouveau age. Klimt\\'s contributions to the dining room, including both Fulfillment and Expectation, were some of his finest decorative work, and as he publicly stated, \"probably the ultimate stage of my development of ornament.\" Between 1907 and 1909, Klimt painted five canvases of society women wrapped in fur. His apparent love of costume is expressed in the many photographs of Flöge modeling clothing he designed.\\n\\nAs he worked and relaxed in his home, Klimt normally wore sandals and a long robe with no undergarments. His simple life was somewhat cloistered, devoted to his art and family and little else except the Secessionist Movement, and he avoided café society and other artists socially. Klimt\\'s fame usually brought patrons to his door, and he could afford to be highly selective. His painting method was very deliberate and painstaking at times and he required lengthy sittings by his subjects. Though very active sexually, he kept his affairs discreet and he avoided personal scandal.\\n\\nKlimt wrote little about his vision or his methods. He wrote mostly postcards to Flöge and kept no diary. In a rare writing called \"Commentary on a non-existent self-portrait\", he states \"I have never painted a self-portrait. I am less interested in myself as a subject for a painting than I am in other people, above all women...There is nothing special about me. I am a painter who paints day after day from morning to night...Who ever wants to know something about me... ought to look carefully at my pictures.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nAdele Bloch-Bauer I, which sold for a record $135 million in 2006. Neue Galerie, New York.\\n\\nIn 1911 his painting Death and Life received first prize in the world exhibitions in Rome. In 1915 his mother Anna died. Klimt died three years later in Vienna on February 6, 1918, having suffered a stroke and pneumonia. He was interred at the Hietzing Cemetery in Vienna. Numerous paintings were left unfinished.\\n\\nKlimt\\'s paintings have brought some of the highest prices recorded for individual works of art. In November 2003, Klimt\\'s Landhaus am Attersee sold for $29,128,000, but that was soon eclipsed by prices paid for other Klimts.\\n\\nIn 2006, the 1907 portrait, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, was purchased for the Neue Galerie in New York by Ronald Lauder for a reported US $135 million, surpassing Picasso\\'s 1905 Boy With a Pipe (sold May 5, 2004 for $104 million), as the highest reported price ever paid for a painting. On August 7, 2006, Christie\\'s auction house announced it was handling the sale of the remaining four works by Klimt that were recovered by Maria Altmann and her co-heirs after their long legal battle against Austria (see Republic of Austria v. Altmann). Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II was sold at auction in November 2006 for $88 million, the third-highest priced piece of art at auction at the time. \\'The Apple Tree I\\' (ca. 1912) sold for $33 million, \\'Birch Forest\\' (1903) sold for $40.3 million, and \\'Houses in Unterach on Lake Atter\\' (1916) sold for $31 million.\\nCollectively, the five restituted paintings netted over $327 million. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKlimt\\'s work is distinguished by the elegant gold or coloured decoration, often of a phallic shape that conceals the more erotic positions of the drawings upon which many of his paintings are based. This can be seen in Judith I (1901), and in The Kiss (1907–1908), and especially in Danaë (1907).  One of the most common themes Klimt used was that of the dominant woman, the femme fatale.\\n\\nArt historians note an eclectic range of influences contributing to Klimt\\'s distinct style, including Egyptian, Minoan, Classical Greek, and Byzantine inspirations. Klimt was also inspired by the engravings of Albrecht Dürer, late medieval European painting, and Japanese Rimpa school. His mature works are characterized by a rejection of earlier naturalistic styles, and make use of symbols or symbolic elements to convey psychological ideas and emphasize the \"freedom\" of art from traditional culture.\\n\\n\\n\\nJudith and the Head of Holofernes, 1901.

His father was a shipwright, ship owner and contractor, and served as the town\\'s chief baillie, while his mother, Agnes Muirhead, came from a distinguished family and was well educated. Both were Presbyterians and strong Covenanters. Watt\\'s grandfather, Thomas Watt, was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the Baron of Cartsburn. Watt did not attend school regularly; initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended Greenock grammar school.    He exhibited great manual dexterity and an aptitude for mathematics, although Latin and Greek failed to interest him, and he absorbed the legends and lore of the Scottish people.\\n\\nWhen he was 18, his mother died and his father\\'s health had begun to fail.  Watt travelled to London to study instrument-making for a year, then returned to Scotland   to Glasgow   intent on setting up his own instrument-making business. However, because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice, the Glasgow Guild of Hammermen (any artisans using hammers) blocked his application, despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in Scotland.\\n\\nWatt was saved from this impasse by three professors of the University of Glasgow, who offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university. It was established in 1758 and one of the professors, the physicist and chemist Joseph Black, became Watt\\'s friend.\\n\\nIn 1764, Watt married his cousin Margaret Miller, with whom he had five children, two of whom lived to adulthood.  She died in childbirth in 1772. In 1777 he married again, to Ann MacGregor, daughter of a Glasgow dye-maker, who survived him. She died in 1832.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatt was an enthusiastic inventor, with a fertile imagination that sometimes got in the way of finishing his works, because he could always see \"just one more improvement\".  He was skilled with his hands, and was also able to perform systematic scientific measurements that could quantify the improvements he made and produce a greater understanding of the phenomenon he was working with.\\n\\nWatt was a gentleman, greatly respected by other prominent men of the Industrial Revolution. He was an important member of the Lunar Society, and was a much sought after conversationalist and companion, always interested in expanding his horizons.  He was a rather poor businessman, and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to utilize the steam engine.  Until he retired, he was always much concerned about his financial affairs, and was something of a worrier. His personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and long-lasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJames Watt\\'s workshop\\n\\nWatt retired in 1800, the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with Boulton expired. The famous partnership was transferred to the men\\'s sons, Matthew Boulton and James Watt Jr. Longtime firm engineer William Murdoch was made a partner and the firm prospered.\\n\\n\"Heathfield\", Watt\\'s house in Handsworth, BirminghamWatt continued to invent other things before and during his semi-retirement. He invented a new method of measuring distances by telescope, a device for copying letters, improvements in the oil lamp, a steam mangle and a machine for copying sculptures. Within his home in Handsworth Heath, Staffordshire, Watt made use of a garret room as a workshop, and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions.\\n\\nHe and his second wife travelled to France and Germany, and he purchased an estate in Wales at Doldowlod House, one mile south of Llanwrthwl, which he much improved.\\n\\nHe died on 25 August 1819 at his home \"Heathfield\" in Handsworth, Birmingham, England at the age of 83.  He was buried on 2 September.\\n\\nThe garret room workshop that Watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until 1853, when it was first viewed by his biographer J. P. Muirhead. Thereafter, it was occasionally visited, but left untouched, as a kind of shrine. A proposal to have it transferred to the Patent Office came to nothing. When the house was due to be demolished in 1924, the room and all its contents were presented to the Science Museum, where it was recreated in its entirety.  Garret workshop of James Watt  It remained on display for visitors for many years, but was walled-off when the gallery it was housed in closed. The workshop remains intact, and preserved, and there are plans for it to go on display again at some point in the near future.\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginal Condenser by James Watt.\\n\\nAs with many major inventions, there is some dispute as to whether Watt was the original sole inventor of some of the numerous inventions he patented. There is no dispute, however, that he was the sole inventor of his most important invention, the separate condenser.  It was his practice (from around the 1780s) to pre-empt others\\' ideas which were known to him by filing patents with the intention of securing credit for the invention for himself, and ensuring that no one else was able to practice it. As he states in a letter to Boulton of 17 August 1784: \\n:I have given such descriptions of engines for wheel carriages as I could do in the time and space I could allow myself; but it is very defective and can only serve to keep other people from similar patents.\\n\\nSome argue that his prohibitions on his employee William Murdoch from working with high pressure steam on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development. Watt, with his partner Matthew Boulton, battled against rival engineers such as Jonathan Hornblower who tried to develop engines which did not fall foul of his patents.\\n\\nWatt patented the  application of the sun and planet gear to steam in 1781 and a steam locomotive in 1784, both of which have strong claims to have been invented by his employee, William Murdoch.  Watt himself described the provenance of the invention of the sun and planet gear in a letter to Boulton from Watt dated 5 January 1782:\\n:I have tried a model of one of my old plans of rotative engines revived and executed by W. M[urdock] and which merits being included in the specification as a fifth method...\\nThe patent was never contested by Murdoch, who remained an employee of Boulton and Watt for most of his life, and Boulton and Watt\\'s firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines, even long after the patent for the crank expired in 1794.\\n\\nWatt opposed the use of high-pressure steam, and many inventors such as Richard Trevithick pioneered such engines, although frequently running into patent infringement actions by Watt. Those more efficient steam engines would eventually displace Watt\\'s engines, leading to another industrial revolution with the development of the steam locomotive.\\n\\n\\n\\nJames Watt statue on City Square at Leeds.\\nWatt celebrated in a statue by Alexander Munro in Chamberlain Square, outside Birmingham Central Library\\n\\nJames Watt\\'s improvements transformed the Newcomen engine, which had hardly changed for fifty years, and initiated changes in generating and applying power, which transformed the world of work, and were a key innovation of the Industrial Revolution.  The importance of the invention can hardly be overstated—it gave us the modern world.  A key feature of it was that it brought the engine out of the remote coal fields into factories where many mechanics, engineers, and even tinkerers were exposed to its virtues and limitations.  It was a platform for generations of inventors to improve.  It was clear to many that higher pressures produced in improved boilers would produce engines having even higher efficiency, and would lead to the revolution in transportation that was soon embodied in the locomotive and steamboat.  It made possible the construction of new factories that, since they were not dependent on water power, could work the year round, and could be placed almost anywhere.  Work was moved out of the cottages, resulting in economies of scale.  Capital could work more efficiently, and manufacturing productivity greatly improved.  It made possible the cascade of new sorts of  machine tools that could be used to produce better machines, including that most remarkable of all of them, the Watt steam engine.\\n\\nOf Watt, the English Novelist Aldous Huxley (1894-1963) wrote; \"To us, the moment 8:17 A.M. means something - something very important, if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train. To our ancestors, such an odd eccentric instant was without significance - did not even exist. In inventing the locomotive, Watt and Stephenson were part inventors of time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatt was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of London.  He was a member of the Batavian Society, and one of only eight Foreign Associates of the French Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nThe watt is named after James Watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine, and was adopted by the Second Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1889 and by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 as the unit of power incorporated in the International System of Units (or \"SI\").  \\n \\'\\n\\n\\n\\nThe James Watt Memorial College in Greenock.\\n\\nWatt was buried in the grounds of St. Mary\\'s Church, Handsworth, in Birmingham. Later expansion of the church, over his grave, means that his tomb is now buried inside the church.  A statue of him, Boulton and Murdoch is in Birmingham, as are five other statues of him alone, one in Chamberlain Square, the other outside the Law Courts. He is also remembered by the Moonstones and a school is named in his honour, both in Birmingham. An extensive archive of his papers is held at Birmingham Central Library. Matthew Boulton\\'s home, Soho House, is now a museum, commemorating the work of both men. The University of Glasgow\\'s Faculty of Engineering, the oldest in the United Kingdom, (where Watt was a professor) has its headquarters in the James Watt Building, which also houses the department of Mechanical Engineering and the department of Aerospace Engineering.\\n\\nThe location of James Watt\\'s birth in Greenock is commemorated by a statue, close to his birthplace. Several locations and street names in Greenock recall him, most notably the Watt Memorial Library, which was begun in 1816 with Watt\\'s donation of scientific books, and developed as part of the Watt Institution by his son (which ultimately became the James Watt College). Taken over by the local authority in 1974, the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of Inverclyde, and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule. Watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in George Square, Glasgow and Princes Street, Edinburgh.\\n\\nThe James Watt College has expanded from its original location to include campuses in Kilwinning (North Ayrshire), Finnart Street and The Waterfront in Greenock, and the Sports campus in Largs. Heriot-Watt University near Edinburgh was at one time the School of Arts of Edinburgh, founded in 1821 as the world’s first Mechanics Institute, but to commemorate George Heriot, the 16th century financier to King James, and James Watt, after Royal Charter the name was changed to Heriot-Watt University. Dozens of university and college buildings (chiefly of science and technology) are named after him.\\n\\nThe huge painting James Watt contemplating the steam engine by James Eckford Lauder is now owned by the National Gallery of Scotland.\\n\\nWatt was ranked first, tying with Edison, among 229 significant figures in the history of technology by Charles Murray\\'s survey of historiometry presented in his book Human Accomplishments. \\nOver 50 roads or streets in the UK are named after him.\\n\\nA colossal statue of Watt by Chantrey was placed in Westminster Abbey, and later was moved to St. Paul\\'s Cathedral.  On the cenotaph the inscription reads:\\n\\nChantrey\\'s statue of James Watt\\n\\n:NOT TO PERPETUATE A NAME,\\n:WHICH MUST ENDURE WHILE THE PEACEFUL ARTS FLOURISH,\\n:BUT TO SHOW\\n:THAT MANKIND HAVE LEARNED TO HONOUR THOSE\\n:WHO BEST DESERVE THEIR GRATITUDE,\\n:THE KING,\\n:HIS MINISTERS, AND MANY OF THE NOBLES\\n:AND COMMONERS OF THE REALM \\n:RAISED THIS MONUMENT TO\\n\\n:JAMES WATT\\n\\n:WHO DIRECTING THE FORCE OF AN ORIGINAL GENIUS\\n:EARLY EXERCISED IN PHILOSOPHIC RESEARCH\\n:TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF\\n:THE STEAM-ENGINE\\n:ENLARGED THE RESOURCES OF HIS COUNTRY\\n:INCREASED THE POWER OF MAN\\n:AND ROSE TO AN EMINENT PLACE\\n:AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS FOLLOWERS OF SCIENCE\\n:AND THE REAL BENEFACTORS OF THE WORLD\\n:BORN AT GREENOCK MDCCXXXVI\\n:DIED AT HEATHFIELD IN STAFFORDSHIRE MDCCCXIX\\n\\nA lecture theatre in the Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering building at the University of Birmingham is named \"G31 - The James Watt Lecture Theatre\".\\n\\nOn 29 May 2009, the Bank of England announced that Watt would appear on a new £50 note, alongside Matthew Boulton.\\n\\n\\n\\n* Watt steam engine\\n* Centrifugal governor\\n* Indicator diagram\\n* Watt\\'s linkage\\n* Parallel motion\\n* Sun and planet gear\\n\\n\\n\\n*\"Some Unpublished Letters of James Watt\" in Journal of Institution of Mechanical Engineers (London, 1915).  \\n*Carnegie, Andrew, James Watt University Press of the Pacific (2001)   (Reprinted from the 1913 ed.),  ISBN 0-89875-578-6.  \\n*  \\n* H.

He evolved a non-representational form which he termed Neo-Plasticism.  This consisted of white ground, upon which was painted a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and the three primary colours. \\n\\n\\n\\nMondrian\\'s birthplace in Amersfoort, Netherlands, now The Mondriaan House, a museum.\\nMondrian was born in Amersfoort in the Netherlands, the second of his parents\\' children. He was descended from Christian Dirkzoon Monderyan who lived in the Hague as early as 1670. The family moved to Winterswijk when his father, Pieter Cornelius Mondriaan, was appointed head teacher at a local primary school. Between his 1905 painting \\'The River Amstel\\' and his 1907 \\'Amaryllis\\', Mondrian changed the spelling of his signature from Mondriaan to Mondrian. Mondrian was introduced to art from a very early age: his father was a qualified drawing teacher, and with his uncle, Fritz Mondriaan (a pupil of Willem Maris of The Hague School of artists), the younger Piet often painted and drew along the river Gein. \\n\\nAfter a strictly Protestant upbringing, in 1892, Mondrian entered the Academy for Fine Art in Amsterdam, already qualified as a teacher.\\n\\nHe began his career as a teacher in primary education, but while teaching he also practiced painting. Most of his work from this period is naturalistic or impressionistic, consisting largely of landscapes. These pastoral images of his native country depict windmills, fields, and rivers, initially in the Dutch Impressionist manner of the Hague School and then in a variety of styles and techniques documenting his search for a personal voice. These paintings are most definitely representational, and illustrate the influence that various artistic movements had on Mondrian, including pointillism and the vivid colors of fauvism.\\n\\nOn display in The Hague\\'s Gemeentemuseum are a number of paintings from this period, including such post-impressionist works as The Red Mill and Trees in Moonlight. Another painting, Evening (Avond) (1908), a scene of haystacks in a field at dusk, even augurs future developments by using a palette consisting almost entirely of red, yellow and blue. Although it is in no sense abstract, Avond is the earliest of Mondrian\\'s works to emphasize the primary colors.\\n\\nPiet Mondrian, View from the Dunes with Beach and Piers, Domburg, oil and pencil on cardboard, 1909, Museum of Modern Art, New York City\\nThe earliest paintings that show an inkling of the abstraction to come are a series of canvases from 1905 to 1908, which depict dim scenes of indistinct trees and houses with reflections in still water. However, although the end result leads the viewer to begin emphasizing the forms over the content, these paintings are still firmly rooted in nature, and it is only the knowledge of Mondrian\\'s later achievements that leads one to search for the roots of his future abstraction in these works.\\n\\nMondrian\\'s art was always intimately related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the theosophical movement launched by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondriaan\\'s work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge.\\n\\nMondrian and his later work were deeply influenced by the 1911 Moderne Kunstkring exhibition of Cubism in Amsterdam. His search for simplification is shown in two versions of Still Life with Ginger Pot  (Stilleven met Gemberpot). The 1911 version is Cubist, in the 1912 version it is reduced to a round shape with triangles and rectangles.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1911, Mondrian moved to Paris and changed his name (dropping an \\'a\\' from Mondriaan) to emphasize his departure from the Netherlands. From this point on, he signed his work as \"Mondrian\". While in Paris, the influence of the style Cubism of Picasso and Braque appeared almost immediately in Mondrian\\'s work. Paintings such as The Sea (1912) and his various studies of trees from that year still contain a measure of representation, but they are increasingly dominated by the geometric shapes and interlocking planes commonly found in Cubism. However, while Mondrian was eager to absorb the Cubist influence into his work, it seems clear that he saw Cubism as port of call on his artistic journey, rather than as a destination.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike the Cubists, Mondrian was still attempting to reconcile his painting with his spiritual pursuits, and in 1913, he began to fuse his art and his theosophical studies into a theory that signaled his final break from representational painting. World War I began while Mondrian was visiting home in 1914, and he was forced to remain in the Netherlands for the duration of the conflict. During this period, he stayed at the Laren artist\\'s colony, there meeting Bart van der Leck and Theo van Doesburg, both artists who were undergoing their own personal journeys toward abstraction at the time. Van der Leck\\'s use of only primary colors in his art greatly influenced Mondrian. With Van Doesburg, Mondrian founded De Stijl (The Style), a journal of De Stijl group in which he published his first essays defining his theory, for which he adopted the term neoplasticism.\\n\\nMondrian published “De Nieuwe Beelding in de schilderkunst” (“The New Plastic in Painting”) in twelve installments during 1917 and 1918. This was his first major attempt to express his artistic theory in writing. However, Mondrian\\'s best and most often-quoted expression of this theory comes from a letter he wrote to H.P. Bremmer in 1914:\\n\\nI construct lines and color combinations on a flat surface, in order to express general beauty with the utmost awareness. Nature (or, that which I see) inspires me, puts me, as with any painter, in an emotional state so that an urge comes about to make something, but I want to come as close as possible to the truth and abstract everything from that, until I reach the foundation (still just an external foundation!) of things…\\n\\nI believe it is possible that, through horizontal and vertical lines constructed with awareness, but not with calculation, led by high intuition, and brought to harmony and rhythm, these basic forms of beauty, supplemented if necessary by other direct lines or curves, can become a work of art, as strong as it is true.\\n\\n\\n\\nPiet Mondrian, Composition with Yellow, Blue, and Red, 1937-42, oil on canvas, 72.5 x 69 cm, Tate Gallery. London.\\nPiet Mondrian, Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow, 1930\\nWhen the war ended in 1919, Mondrian returned to France, where he would remain until 1938. Immersed in the crucible of artistic innovation that was post-war Paris, he flourished in an atmosphere of intellectual freedom that enabled him to embrace an art of pure abstraction for the rest of his life. Mondrian began producing grid-based paintings in late 1919, and in 1920, the style for which he came to be renowned began to appear.\\n\\nIn the early paintings of this style the lines delineating the rectangular forms are relatively thin, and they are gray, not black. The lines also tend to fade as they approach the edge of the painting, rather than stopping abruptly. The forms themselves, smaller and more numerous than in later paintings, are filled with primary colors, black, or gray, and nearly all of them are colored; only a few are left white.\\n\\nDuring late 1920 and 1921, Mondrian\\'s paintings arrive at what are their definitive and mature form to casual observers. Thick black lines now separate the forms, which are larger and fewer in number, and more of them are left white than was previously the case. This was not the culmination of his artistic evolution, however. Although the refinements became more subtle, Mondrian\\'s work continued to evolve during his years in Paris.\\n\\nIn the 1921 paintings, many of the black lines (but not all of them) stop short at a seemingly arbitrary distance from the edge of the canvas, although the divisions between the rectangular forms remain intact. Here too, the rectangular forms are still mostly colored. As the years passed and Mondrian\\'s work evolved further, he began extending all of the lines to the edges of the canvas, and he also began to use fewer and fewer colored forms, favoring white instead.\\n\\nThese tendencies are particularly obvious in the “lozenge” works that Mondrian began producing with regularity in the mid-1920s. The \"lozenge\" paintings are square canvases tilted 45 degrees, so that they hang in a diamond shape. Typical of these is Schilderij No. 1: Lozenge With Two Lines and Blue (1926), also known as Composition With Blue and Composition in White and Blue, which is currently on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. One of the most minimal of Mondrian\\'s canvases, this painting consists only of two black, perpendicular lines and a small triangular form, colored blue. The lines extend all the way to the edges of the canvas, almost giving the impression that the painting is a fragment of a larger work.\\n\\nAlthough one is hampered by the glass protecting the painting, and by the toll that age and handling have obviously taken on the canvas, a close examination of this painting begins to reveal something of the artist\\'s method.  Mondrian\\'s paintings are not composed of perfectly flat planes of color, as one might expect. Brush strokes are evident throughout, although they are subtle, and the artist appears to have used different techniques for the various elements.\\n\\nThe black lines are the flattest elements, with the least amount of depth. The colored forms have the most obvious brush strokes, all running in one direction. Most interesting, however, are the white forms, which clearly have been painted in layers, using brush strokes running in different directions. This generates a greater sense of depth in the white forms, as though they are overwhelming the lines and the colors, which indeed they were, as Mondrian\\'s paintings of this period came to be increasingly dominated by white space.\\n\\nSchilderij No. 1 may be the most extreme extent of Mondrian\\'s minimalism. As the years progressed, lines began to take precedence over forms in his painting. In the 1930s, he began to use thinner lines and double lines more frequently, punctuated with a few small colored forms, if any at all. Double lines particularly excited Mondrian, for he believed they offered his paintings a new dynamism which he was eager to explore.\\n\\n\\n\\nPiet Mondrian, Composition 10, 1939-1942, private collection.\\n\\nIn September 1938, Mondrian left Paris in the face of advancing fascism and moved to London. After the Netherlands were invaded and Paris fell in 1940, he left London for New York City, where he would remain until his death. Some of Mondrian\\'s later works are difficult to place in terms of his artistic development, because there were quite a few canvases that he began in Paris or London which he only completed months or years later in New York. However, the finished works from this later period demonstrate an unprecedented busy-ness, with more lines than any of his work since the 1920s, placed in an overlapping arrangement that is almost cartographical in appearance. He spent many long hours painting on his own until his hands blistered and he sometimes cried or made himself sick.\\n\\nMondrian produced Lozenge Composition With Four Yellow Lines (1933), a simple painting that introduced what for him was a shocking innovation: thick, colored lines instead of black ones. After that one painting, this practice remained dormant in Mondrian\\'s work until he arrived in New York, at which time he began to embrace it with abandon. In some examples of this new direction, such as Composition (1938) / Place de la Concorde (1943), he appears to have taken unfinished black-line paintings from Paris and completed them in New York by adding short perpendicular lines of different colors, running between the longer black lines, or from a black line to the edge of the canvas. The newly-colored areas are thick, almost bridging the gap between lines and forms, and it is startling to see color in a Mondrian painting that is unbounded by black. Other works mix long lines of red amidst the familiar black lines, creating a new sense of depth by the addition of a colored layer on top of the black one.\\n\\nThe new canvases that Mondrian began in New York are even more startling, and indicate the beginning of a new idiom that was cut short by the artist\\'s death. New York City (1942) is a complex lattice of red, blue, and yellow lines, occasionally interlacing to create a greater sense of depth than his previous works. An unfinished 1941 version of this work uses strips of painted paper tape, which the artist could rearrange at will to experiment with different designs.\\n\\nHis painting Broadway Boogie-Woogie (1942–43) at The Museum of Modern Art in New York City was highly influential in the school of abstract geometric painting. The piece is made up of a number of shimmering squares of bright color that leap from the canvas, then appear to shimmer, drawing the viewer into those neon lights.  In this painting and the unfinished Victory Boogie Woogie (1942-44), Mondrian replaced former solid lines with lines created from small adjoining rectangles of color, created in part by using small pieces of paper tape in various colors. Larger unbounded rectangles of color punctuate the design, some with smaller concentric rectangles inside them. While Mondrian\\'s works of the 1920s and 1930s tend to have an almost scientific austerity about them, these are bright, lively paintings, reflecting the upbeat music that inspired them and the city in which they were made.\\n\\nMondrian wrote, on a postcard to art historian James Johnson Sweeney, planner of a retrospective exhibition of the artist\\'s works at The Museum of Modern Art in New York: \"Only now [in 1943], I become conscious that my work in black, white, and little color planes has been merely \\'drawing\\' in oil color. In drawing, the lines are the principal means of expression; in painting, the color planes. In painting, however, the lines are absorbed by the color planes; but the limitation of the planes show themselves as lines and conserve their great value.\"   In these final works, the forms have indeed usurped the role of the lines, opening another new door for Mondrian\\'s development as an abstractionist. The Boogie-Woogie paintings were clearly more of a revolutionary change than an evolutionary one, representing the most profound development in Mondrian\\'s work since his abandonment of representational art in 1913.\\n\\nIn 2008 the Dutch television program Andere Tijden found the only known movie footage with Mondrian. The discovery of the film footage was announced at the end of a two-year research program on the \\'Victory Boogie Woogie\\'. The research found that the painting was in very good condition and that Mondrian painted the composition in one session. It was also found that the composition was radically changed by Mondrian shortly before his death by using small pieces of colored tape.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen 47-year-old Piet Mondrian left the Netherlands for unfettered Paris for the second and last time in 1919, he set about at once to make his studio a nurturing environment for paintings he had in mind that would increasingly express the principles of Neo-Plasticism about which he had been writing for two years. To hide the studio\\'s structural flaws quickly and inexpensively, he tacked up large rectangular placards, each in a single color or neutral hue. Smaller colored paper squares and rectangles, composed together, accented the walls. Then came an intense period of painting. Then again he addressed the walls, repositioning the colored cutouts, adding to their number, altering the dynamics of color and space, producing new tensions and equilibrium. Before long, he had established a creative schedule in which a period of painting took turns with a period of experimentally regrouping the smaller papers on the walls, a process that directly fed the next period of painting. It was a pattern he followed for the rest of his life, through wartime moves from Paris to London’s Hampstead in 1938 and 1940, across the Atlantic to Manhattan.\\n\\nAt 71 in the fall of 1943, Mondrian moved into his second and final New York studio at 15 East 59th Street, and set about again to create the environment he had learned over the years was most congenial to his modest way of life and most stimulating to his art. He painted the high walls the same off-white he used on his easel and on the seats, tables and storage cases he designed and fashioned meticulously from discarded orange and apple-crates. He glossed the top of a white metal stool in the same brilliant primary red he applied to the cardboard sheath he made for the radio-phonograph that spilled forth his beloved jazz from well-traveled records, Visitors to this last studio seldom saw more than one or two new canvases, but found, often to their astonishment, that eight large compositions of colored bits of paper he had tacked and re-tacked to the walls in ever-changing relationships constituted together an environment that, paradoxically and simultaneously, was both kinetic and serene, stimulating and restful. It was the best space, Mondrian said, that he had ever inhabited. Tragically, he was there for only a few months: he died of pneumonia in February 1944.\\n\\nAfter his death, Mondrian’s friend and sponsor in New York, artist Harry Holtzman, and another painter friend, Fritz Glarner, carefully documented the studio on film and in still photographs before opening it to the public for a six-week exhibition. Before dismantling the studio, Holtzman (who was also Mondrian’s heir) traced the wall compositions precisely, prepared exact portable facsimiles of the space each had occupied, and affixed to each the original surviving cut-out components. These portable Mondrian compositions have become known as \"The Wall Works\". They have been exhibited twice since Mondrian’s death at New York’s Museum of Modern Art (1983/1995-96), once in Soho at The Carpenter + Hochman Gallery (1984), once each at Galerie Tokoro in Tokyo, Japan. (1993), the XXII Biennial of Sao Paulo (1994), The University of Michigan (1995) and, the first time to be shown in Europe, at the Akademie der Künste (Academy of The Arts), in Berlin (February 22-April 22, 2007).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPiet Mondrian died of pneumonia on February 1, 1944 and was interred in the Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\\n\\nOn 3 February 1944, a memorial, attended by nearly 200, was held for Mondrian, at the Universal Chapel on Lexington Ave and 52nd St. in New York City.\\n\\nThe Mondrian / Holtzman Trust functions as Mondrian\\'s official Estate, and \"aims to promote awareness of Mondrian\\'s artwork and to ensure the integrity of his work.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*Along with Klee and Kandinsky, Mondrian was one of the main inspirations to the early pointillist musical aesthetic of serialist composer Pierre Boulez.\\n\\n*In 2001-2003 British artist Keith Milow made a series of painting based on the so-called Transatlantic Paintings (1935-1940) by Mondrian.

Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Italian Leonardo da Vinci.\\n\\nMichelangelo\\'s output in every field during his long life was prodigious; when the sheer volume of correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences that survive is also taken into account, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century. Two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted before he turned thirty. Despite his low opinion of painting, Michelangelo also created two of the most influential works in fresco in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling and The Last Judgment on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.  As an architect, Michelangelo pioneered the Mannerist style at the Laurentian Library. At 74 he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of Saint Peter\\'s Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan, the western end being finished to Michelangelo\\'s design, the dome being completed after his death with some modification.\\n\\nIn a demonstration of Michelangelo\\'s unique standing, he was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive. Two biographies were published of him during his lifetime; one of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that he was the pinnacle of all artistic achievement since the beginning of the Renaissance, a viewpoint that continued to have currency in art history for centuries. In his lifetime he was also often called Il Divino (\"the divine one\").  One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his terribilità, a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and it was the attempts of subsequent artists to imitate Michelangelo\\'s impassioned and highly personal style that resulted in Mannerism, the next major movement in Western art after the High Renaissance.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelangelo was born on 6 March 1475 in Caprese near Arezzo, Tuscany.  His family had for several generations been small-scale bankers in Florence but his father, Lodovico di Leonardo di Buonarroti di Simoni, failed to maintain the bank\\'s financial status, and held occasional government positions.  At the time of Michelangelo\\'s birth, his father was the Judicial administrator of the small town of Caprese and local administrator of Chiusi. Michelangelo\\'s mother was Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena.  The Buonarrotis claimed to descend from the Countess Mathilde of Canossa; this claim remains unproven, but Michelangelo himself believed it. Several months after Michelangelo\\'s birth the family returned to Florence where Michelangelo was raised. At later times, during the prolonged illness and after the death of his mother when he was seven years old, Michelangelo lived with a stonecutter and his wife and family in the town of Settignano where his father owned a marble quarry and a small farm.  Giorgio Vasari quotes Michelangelo as saying, \"If there is some good in me, it is because I was born in the subtle atmosphere of your country of Arezzo. Along with the milk of my nurse I received the knack of handling chisel and hammer, with which I make my figures.\"\\n\\nMichelangelo\\'s father sent him to study grammar with the Humanist Francesco da Urbino in Florence as a young boy.  The young artist, however, showed no interest in his schooling, preferring to copy paintings from churches and seek the company of painters.  At thirteen, Michelangelo was apprenticed to the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio.  When Michelangelo was only fourteen, his father persuaded Ghirlandaio to pay his apprentice as an artist, which was highly unusual at the time.  When in 1489 Lorenzo de\\' Medici, de facto ruler of Florence, asked Ghirlandaio for his two best pupils, Ghirlandaio sent Michelangelo and Francesco Granacci.  From 1490 to 1492, Michelangelo attended the Humanist academy which the Medici had founded along Neo Platonic lines. Michelangelo studied sculpture under Bertoldo di Giovanni. At the academy, both Michelangelo\\'s outlook and his art were subject to the influence of many of the most prominent philosophers and writers of the day including Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola and Angelo Poliziano.  At this time Michelangelo sculpted the reliefs Madonna of the Steps (1490 1492) and Battle of the Centaurs (1491 1492). The latter was based on a theme suggested by Poliziano and was commissioned by Lorenzo de Medici.  \\nWhile both were apprenticed to Bertoldo di Giovanni, Pietro Torrigiano struck the 17 year old on the nose, and thus caused that disfigurement which is so conspicuous in all the portraits of Michelangelo.\\n\\n\\n\\nLorenzo de\\' Medici\\'s death on 8 April 1492, brought a reversal of Michelangelo\\'s circumstances.  Michelangelo left the security of the Medici court and returned to his father\\'s house. In the following months he carved a wooden crucifix (1493), as a gift to the prior of the Florentine church of Santo Spirito, who had permitted him some studies of anatomy on the corpses of the church\\'s hospital.  Between 1493 and 1494 he bought a block of marble for a larger than life statue of Hercules, which was sent to France and subsequently disappeared sometime circa 1700s.   On 20 January 1494, after heavy snowfalls, Lorenzo\\'s heir, Piero de Medici commissioned a snow statue, and Michelangelo again entered the court of the Medici.\\n\\nIn the same year, the Medici were expelled from Florence as the result of the rise of Savonarola. Michelangelo left the city before the end of the political upheaval, moving to Venice and then to Bologna.  In Bologna he was commissioned to finish the carving of the last small figures of the Shrine of St. Dominic, in the church dedicated to that saint. Towards the end 1494, the political situation in Florence was calmer. The city, previously under threat from the French, was no longer in danger as Charles VIII had suffered defeats. Michelangelo returned to Florence but received no commissions from the new city government under Savonarola. He returned to the employment of the Medici.  During the half year he spent in Florence he worked on two small statues, a child St. John the Baptist and a sleeping Cupid. According to Condivi, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de\\' Medici, for whom Michelangelo had sculpted St. John the Baptist, asked that Michelangelo \"fix it so that it looked as if it had been buried\" so he could \"send it to Rome...pass [it off as] an ancient work and...sell it much better.\" Both Lorenzo and Michelangelo were unwittingly cheated out of the real value of the piece by a middleman. Cardinal Raffaele Riario, to whom Lorenzo had sold it, discovered that it was a fraud, but was so impressed by the quality of the sculpture that he invited the artist to Rome.  This apparent success in selling his sculpture abroad as well as the conservative Florentine situation may have encouraged Michelangelo to accept the prelate\\'s invitation.\\n\\nMichelangelo\\'s Pietà, a depiction of the body of Jesus on the lap of his mother Mary after the Crucifixion, was carved in 1499, when the sculptor was 24 years old.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelangelo arrived in Rome 25 June 1496 at the age of 21. On 4 July of the same year, he began work on a commission for Cardinal Raffaele Riario, an over-life-size statue of the Roman wine god, Bacchus. However, upon completion, the work was rejected by the cardinal, and subsequently entered the collection of the banker Jacopo Galli, for his garden.\\n\\nIn November of 1497, the French ambassador in the Holy See commissioned one of his most famous works, the Pietà and the contract was agreed upon in August of the following year. The contemporary opinion about this work — \"a revelation of all the potentialities and force of the art of sculpture\" — was summarized by Vasari: \"It is certainly a miracle that a formless block of stone could ever have been reduced to a perfection that nature is scarcely able to create in the flesh.\"\\n\\nIn Rome, Michelangelo lived near the church of Santa Maria di Loreto. Here, according to the legend, he fell in love with Vittoria Colonna, marquise of Pescara and a poet.  His house was demolished in 1874, and the remaining architectural elements saved by the new proprietors were destroyed in 1930. Today a modern reconstruction of Michelangelo\\'s house can be seen on the Gianicolo hill. It is also during this period that skeptics allege Michelangelo executed the sculpture Laocoön and His Sons which resides in the Vatican Catterson, Lynn. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Statue of David, completed by Michelangelo in 1504, is one of the most renowned works of the Renaissance.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelangelo returned to Florence in 1499 1501. Things were changing in the republic after the fall of anti-Renaissance Priest and leader of Florence, Girolamo Savonarola (executed in 1498) and the rise of the gonfaloniere Pier Soderini. He was asked by the consuls of the Guild of Wool to complete an unfinished project begun 40 years earlier by Agostino di Duccio: a colossal statue portraying David as a symbol of Florentine freedom, to be placed in the Piazza della Signoria, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio. Michelangelo responded by completing his most famous work, the Statue of David in 1504. This masterwork, created out of a marble block from the quarries at Carrara that had already been worked on by an earlier hand, definitively established his prominence as a sculptor of extraordinary technical skill and strength of symbolic imagination.\\n\\nAlso during this period, Michelangelo painted the Holy Family and St John, also known as the Doni Tondo or the Holy Family of the Tribune: it was commissioned for the marriage of Angelo Doni and Maddalena Strozzi and in the 17th century hung in the room known as the Tribune in the Uffizi. He also may have painted the Madonna and Child with John the Baptist, known as the Manchester Madonna and now in the National Gallery, London.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; the work took approximately four years to complete (1508–1512)\\nIn 1505 Michelangelo was invited back to Rome by the newly elected Pope Julius II. He was commissioned to build the Pope\\'s tomb. Under the patronage of the Pope, Michelangelo had to constantly stop work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks. Because of these interruptions, Michelangelo worked on the tomb for 40 years. The tomb, of which the central feature is Michelangelo\\'s statue of Moses, was never finished to Michelangelo\\'s satisfaction. It is located in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli in Rome.\\n\\nDuring the same period, Michelangelo took the commission to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which took approximately four years to complete (1508 1512). According to Michelangelo\\'s account, Bramante and Raphael convinced the Pope to commission Michelangelo in a medium not familiar to the artist. This was done in order that he, Michelangelo, would suffer unfavorable comparisons with his rival Raphael, who at the time was at the peak of his own artistry as the primo fresco painter. However, this story is discounted by modern historians on the grounds of contemporary evidence, and may merely have been a reflection of the artist\\'s own perspective.\\n\\nMichelangelo was originally commissioned to paint the 12 Apostles against a starry sky, but lobbied for a different and more complex scheme, representing creation, the Downfall of Man and the Promise of Salvation through the prophets and Genealogy of Christ. The work is part of a larger scheme of decoration within the chapel which represents much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church\\n\\nThe composition eventually contained over 300 figures and had at its center nine episodes from the Book of Genesis, divided into three groups: God\\'s Creation of the Earth; God\\'s Creation of Humankind and their fall from God\\'s grace; and lastly, the state of Humanity as represented by Noah and his family. On the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of the Jesus. They are seven prophets of Israel and five Sibyls, prophetic women of the Classical world.\\n\\nAmong the most famous paintings on the ceiling are the Creation of Adam, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, the Great Flood, the Prophet Isaiah and the Cumaean Sibyl. Around the windows are painted the ancestors of Christ.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelangelo\\'s Moses (centre) with Rachel and Leah on his sides.\\nIn 1513 Pope Julius II died and his successor Pope Leo X, a Medici, commissioned Michelangelo to reconstruct the façade of the basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence and to adorn it with sculptures. Michelangelo agreed reluctantly. The three years he spent in creating drawings and models for the facade, as well as attempting to open a new marble quarry at Pietrasanta specifically for the project, were among the most frustrating in his career, as work was abruptly cancelled by his financially-strapped patrons before any real progress had been made. The basilica lacks a facade to this day.\\n\\nApparently not the least embarrassed by this turnabout, the Medici later came back to Michelangelo with another grand proposal, this time for a family funerary chapel in the basilica of San Lorenzo. Fortunately for posterity, this project, occupying the artist for much of the 1520s and 1530s, was more fully realized. Though still incomplete, it is the best example we have of the integration of the artist\\'s sculptural and architectural vision, since Michelangelo created both the major sculptures as well as the interior plan. Ironically the most prominent tombs are those of two rather obscure Medici who died young, a son and grandson of Lorenzo. Il Magnifico himself is buried in an unfinished and comparatively unimpressive tomb on one of the side walls of the chapel, not given a free-standing monument, as originally intended.\\n\\nMichelangelo\\'s The Last Judgment. Saint Bartholomew is shown holding the knife of his martyrdom and his flayed skin. The face of the skin is recognizable as Michelangelo.\\nIn 1527, the Florentine citizens, encouraged by the sack of Rome, threw out the Medici and restored the republic. A siege of the city ensued, and Michelangelo went to the aid of his beloved Florence by working on the city\\'s fortifications from 1528 to 1529. The city fell in 1530 and the Medici were restored to power. Completely out of sympathy with the repressive reign of the ducal Medici, Michelangelo left Florence for good in the mid-1530s, leaving assistants to complete the Medici chapel. Years later his body was brought back from Rome for interment at the Basilica di Santa Croce, fulfilling the maestro\\'s last request to be buried in his beloved Tuscany.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fresco of The Last Judgment on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel was commissioned by Pope Clement VII, who died shortly after assigning the commission. Paul III was instrumental in seeing that Michelangelo began and completed the project. Michelangelo labored on the project from 1534 to October 1541. The work is massive and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. The Last Judgment is a depiction of the second coming of Christ and the apocalypse; where the souls of humanity rise and are assigned to their various fates, as judged by Christ, surrounded by the Saints.\\n\\nOnce completed, the depictions of nakedness in the papal chapel was considered obscene and sacrilegious, and Cardinal Carafa and Monsignor Sernini (Mantua\\'s ambassador) campaigned to have the fresco removed or censored, but the Pope resisted. After Michelangelo\\'s death, it was decided to obscure the genitals (\"Pictura in Cappella Ap.ca coopriantur\"). So Daniele da Volterra, an apprentice of Michelangelo, was commissioned to cover with perizomas (briefs) the genitals, leaving unaltered the complex of bodies. When the work was restored in 1993, the conservators chose not to remove all the perizomas of Daniele, leaving some of them as a historical document, and because some of Michelangelo’s work was previously scraped away by the touch-up artist\\'s application of “decency” to the masterpiece. A faithful uncensored copy of the original, by Marcello Venusti, can be seen at the Capodimonte Museum of Naples.\\nMichelangelo designed the dome of St. Peter\\'s Basilica, although it was unfinished when he died.\\nCensorship always followed Michelangelo, once described as \"inventor delle porcherie\" (\"inventor of obscenities\", in the original Italian language referring to \"pork things\"). The infamous \"fig-leaf campaign\" of the Counter-Reformation, aiming to cover all representations of human genitals in paintings and sculptures, started with Michelangelo\\'s works. To give two examples, the marble statue of Cristo della Minerva (church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome) was covered by added drapery, as it remains today, and the statue of the naked child Jesus in Madonna of Bruges (The Church of Our Lady in Bruges, Belgium) remained covered for several decades. Also, the plaster copy of the David in the Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum) in London, has a fig leaf in a box at the back of the statue. It was there to be placed over the statue\\'s genitals so that they would not upset visiting female royalty.\\n\\nIn 1546, Michelangelo was appointed architect of St. Peter\\'s Basilica in the Vatican, and designed its dome. As St. Peter\\'s was progressing there was concern that Michelangelo would pass away before the dome was finished. However, once building commenced on the lower part of the dome, the supporting ring, the completion of the design was inevitable.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 7 December 2007, Michelangelo\\'s red chalk sketch for the dome of St Peter\\'s Basilica, his last before his 1564 death, was discovered in the Vatican archives. It is extremely rare, since he destroyed his designs later in life. The sketch is a partial plan for one of the radial columns of the cupola drum of Saint Peter\\'s.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelangelo\\'s own tomb, at Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze, Florence\\nMichelangelo worked on many projects that had been started by other men, most notably in his work at St Peter\\'s Basilica, Rome. The Campidoglio, designed by Michelangelo during the same period, rationalized the structures and spaces of Rome\\'s Capitoline Hill. Its shape, more a rhomboid than a square, was intended to counteract the effects of perspective. The major Florentine architectural projects by Michelangelo are the unexecuted façade for the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence and the Medici Chapel (Capella Medicea) and Laurentian Library there, and the fortifications of Florence. The major Roman projects are St. Peter\\'s, Palazzo Farnese, San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, the Sforza Chapel (Capella Sforza) in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, Porta Pia and Santa Maria degli Angeli.\\n\\n\\n\\nAround 1530 Michelangelo designed the Laurentian Library in Florence, attached to the church of San Lorenzo. He produced new styles such as pilasters tapering thinner at the bottom, and a staircase with contrasting rectangular and curving forms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelangelo designed the Medici Chapel. The Medici Chapel has monuments in it dedicated to certain members of the Medici family. Michelangelo never finished it, so his pupils later completed it. Lorenzo the Magnificent was buried at the entrance wall of the Medici Chapel. Sculptures of the \"Madonna and Child\" and the Medici patron saints Cosmas and Damian were set over his burial. The \"madonna and child\" was Michelangelo\\'s own work.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelangelo, who was often arrogant with others and constantly dissatisfied with himself, saw art as originating from inner inspiration and from culture. In contradiction to the ideas of his rival, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo saw nature as an enemy that had to be overcome. The figures that he created are forceful and dynamic, each in its own space apart from the outside world. For Michelangelo, the job of the sculptor was to free the forms that were already inside the stone. He believed that every stone had a sculpture within it, and that the work of sculpting was simply a matter of chipping away all that was not a part of the statue.\\n\\nSeveral anecdotes reveal that Michelangelo\\'s skill, especially in sculpture, was greatly admired in his own time. Another Lorenzo de Medici wanted to use Michelangelo to make some money. He had Michelangelo sculpt a Cupid that looked worn and old. Lorenzo paid Michelangelo 30 ducats, but sold the Cupid for 200 ducats. Cardinal Raffaele Riario became suspicious and sent someone to investigate. The man had Michelangelo do a sketch for him of a Cupid, and then told Michelangelo that while he received 30 ducats for his Cupid, Lorenzo had passed the Cupid off for an antique and sold it for 200 ducats. Michelangelo then confessed that he had done the Cupid, but had no idea that he had been cheated. After the truth was revealed, the Cardinal later took this as proof of his skill and commissioned his Bacchus. Another better-known anecdote claims that when finishing the Moses (San Pietro in Vincoli, Rome), Michelangelo violently hit the knee of the statue with a hammer, shouting, \"Why don\\'t you speak to me?\"\\n\\nIn his personal life, Michelangelo was abstemious. He told his apprentice, Ascanio Condivi: \"However rich I may have been, I have always lived like a poor man.\"  Condivi said he was indifferent to food and drink, eating \"more out of necessity than of pleasure\" and that he \"often slept in his clothes and ... boots.\"  These habits may have made him unpopular. His biographer Paolo Giovio says, \"His nature was so rough and uncouth that his domestic habits were incredibly squalid, and deprived posterity of any pupils who might have followed him.\"   He may not have minded, since he was by nature a solitary and melancholy person. He had a reputation for being bizzarro e fantastico because he \"withdrew himself from the company of men.\"  \\n\\n\\n\\nDrawing for The Libyan Sybil, New York City, Metropolitan Museum of Art\\nThe Libyan Sybil, Sistine Chapel, accomplished.\\nFundamental to Michelangelo\\'s art is his love of male beauty, which attracted him both aesthetically and emotionally. In part, this was an expression of the Renaissance idealization of masculinity. But in Michelangelo\\'s art there is clearly a sensual response to this aesthetic. \\n\\nThe sculptor\\'s expressions of love have been characterized as both Neoplatonic and openly homoerotic; recent scholarship seeks an interpretation which respects both readings, yet is wary of drawing absolute conclusions.  One example of the conundrum is Cecchino dei Bracci, whose death, only a year after their meeting in 1543, inspired the writing of forty eight funeral epigrams, which by some accounts allude to a relationship that was not only romantic but physical as well:\\n:\\n\\nAccording to others, they represent an emotionless and elegant re-imagining of Platonic dialogue, whereby erotic poetry was seen as an expression of refined sensibilities (Indeed, it must be remembered that professions of love in 16th century Italy were given a far wider application than now).  Some young men were street wise and took advantage of the sculptor. Febbo di Poggio, in 1532, peddled his charms in answer to Michelangelo\\'s love poem he asks for money. Earlier, Gherardo Perini, in 1522, had stolen from him shamelessly. Michelangelo defended his privacy above all. When an employee of his friend Niccolò Quaratesi offered his son as apprentice suggesting that he would be good even in bed, Michelangelo refused indignantly, suggesting Quaratesi fire the man.\\n\\nThe greatest written expression of his love was given to Tommaso dei Cavalieri (c. 1509 1587), who was 23 years old when Michelangelo met him in 1532, at the age of 57. Cavalieri was open to the older man\\'s affection: I swear to return your love. Never have I loved a man more than I love you, never have I wished for a friendship more than I wish for yours. Cavalieri remained devoted to Michelangelo until his death.\\n\\nMichelangelo dedicated to him over three hundred sonnets and madrigals, constituting the largest sequence of poems composed by him. Some modern commentators assert that the relationship was merely a Platonic affection, even suggesting that Michelangelo was seeking a surrogate son.  The text goes so far as to claim, a bit defensively, \\'These have naturally been interpreted as indications that Michelangelo was a homosexual, but such a reaction according to the artist\\'s own statement would be that of the ignorant\\'.  However, their homoerotic nature was recognized in his own time, so that a decorous veil was drawn across them by his grand nephew, Michelangelo the Younger, who published an edition of the poetry in 1623 with the gender of pronouns changed. John Addington Symonds, the early British homosexual activist, undid this change by translating the original sonnets into English and writing a two-volume biography, published in 1893.\\n\\nA Ignudo, Sistine Chapel.\\nThe sonnets are the first large sequence of poems in any modern tongue addressed by one man to another, predating Shakespeare\\'s sonnets to his young friend by a good fifty years.\\n\\nLate in life he nurtured a great love for the poet and noble widow Vittoria Colonna, whom he met in Rome in 1536 or 1538 and who was in her late forties at the time. They wrote sonnets for each other and were in regular contact until she died.\\n\\nIt is impossible to know for certain whether Michelangelo had physical relationships (Condivi ascribed to him a \"monk-like chastity\"), but through his poetry and visual art we may at least glimpse the arc of his imagination. \\n\\n\\n\\n*List of works by Michelangelo\\n*Michelangelo phenomenon\\n*Renaissance painting\\n*Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes\\n\\nThe asteroid 3001 Michelangelo and a crater on the planet Mercury were named after Michelangelo.
